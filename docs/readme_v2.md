# MemorativaOracle - Dynamic Memory Palace & Symbolic Correspondence Engine

## Vision
Memorativa is an innovative application that merges traditional memory palace techniques with dynamic celestial influences. At its heart lies a grand central hall that responds to the movements of heavenly bodies, creating a living space where wisdom can be stored, explored, and shared. The system combines accurate astronomical data with esoteric traditions, allowing users to navigate their personal palace through both physical space and celestial time.
