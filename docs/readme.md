## Vision
The **digital memory palace (DMP)** is a new way to organize and understand the world's content. A DMP enables users to organize, and understand online content using symbolic patterns, relationships, and patterns.

**Memorativa** is an application that automatically organizes and curates online content using a customizable and extensible open-source DMP.

## How it works
- User creates a DMP 
  - can be created, edited, merged, shared, and exported
  - through the command line interface: `npm memorativa create`
  - through the web interface
  - through the API
- Content is submitted to Memorativa via a link or a URL (manually or API).
- The user provides a note, tags, location, or instructions for the content.
  - Tags are automatically generated from the content.
  - User selects a primary content location (based on the 12 houses, AI chooses the best location by default):
    - 1. Personal Identity
       - Profiles, bios, personal goals
       - Self-reflections, aspirations
       - Personal brand content, social media presence
       - Style, fashion, self-expression
    - 2. Resources & Collections

       - Saved content for later
       - Inspirational content
- Memorativa stores the link + metadata + category. This is called the **entry**.
- Memorativa uses AI to understand, organize, and curate the **entries**.
- Memorativa stores and presents the **entries** within the DMP user experience.

## Digital Memory Palaces
Users create a DMP that curates ideas, notes, media and other content, while simultaneously navigating through a universe of symbolic lenses that provide a deeper symbolic understanding of the content. The application's core architecture integrates Ficino's astrological memory system to create a living space where content can be stored, explored, and shared.

Users add content (links) to the DMP, and the DMP automatically curates and organizes the content based on various symbols, relationships, and organizational patterns it extracts and stores from the content.

The DMP is based on **the art of memory**, which is an ancient collection of methods for storing, organizing, and retrieving memories using imaginative and symbolic mental representations. The DMP adopts a digital form of the astrological memory system of **Marsilio Ficino**, which is a dynamic system that uses the positions of the sun, moon, and planets to organize and categorize content.

## Palace Architecture
The palace architecture consists of a great **Solar Hall**. 

  - The Solar Hall is a circular, mandala-like room and spatial representation of the memory palace.
  - The Solar Hall can be rendered as an ancient, fabled, mythological, historical, or modern structure according to the user's preferences.
  - The Solar Hall contains **Houses**, which are 12 distinct zones within the hall based on the astrological memory system of **Marsilio Ficino**.
  - Each section of the hall is visually and dynamically influenced by the movement of the **Planetary Archetypes**, which are the dynamic planetary influences used by **Marsilio Ficino**.
  - The Solar Hall can contain furnishings, themes, and decorations that are symbolic and can be acquired and added to the palace.

### Vertical Organization

  - New entries appear at ceiling level
  - Content flows downward over time
  - Ground level is the present
  - Floor level represents past times below or future times above
  - Dynamic column generation based on content patterns
  - Column types:
    - Hanging tapestries for narrative content
    - Crystal columns for structured data
    - Living vines for evolving content
    - Stone pillars for foundational material
    - Light beams for trending content
    - Water columns for fluid/changing content
    - Dynamic bookshelf columns for concepts and categories
    - Paintings columns for visual content

Overlaying the hall is the astrological houses, which further categorize the content and define the room structure. Further overlaying the hall are the thematic influences of the Ficino system, such as the planetary influences, which further categorize the content and define the room structure.

### House-Based Sections
- **Twelve Primary Zones**
  - Each house manifests as a distinct functional area
  - Thematic alignment with traditional house meanings
  - Flexible boundaries responding to house cusps
  - Interactive zones for content placement
  - Passage points to extended rooms

### House-Based Categories and Segmentation
Houses are a traditional method of organizing content in a memory palace. Houses are divided into 12 sections, with each section representing a specific aspect of life.
  - 1st House: Personal palace attributes
  - 2nd House: Resource collections
  - 3rd House: Connection networks
  - 4th House: Foundation content
  - 5th House: Creative expressions
  - 6th House: Practice methods
  - 7th House: Shared palaces
  - 8th House: Transformation markers
  - 9th House: Teaching collections

#### Celestial Levels

## Content
Content is submitted manually (add a link) or automatically generated when a user on X.com bookmarks or shares a post, as one example. A user would link and authorize their X account and then be able to add content to the palace. The link is then stored and automatically organized and curated in the DMP, based on various symbols, relationships, and organizational patterns. Similarly, the content from the link (news, blog, tweet, video, etc.) would be analyzed, extracted to text and metadata, represented as data, and then stored and automatically curated in a DMP, based on various symbols, relationships, and organizational patterns.

### Lenses
**Lenses** are content curation algorithms that are based on different symbolic systems and that are applied by users to filter, relate, and surface content based on various symbols, relationships, and organizational patterns related to the content.

The lens is defined by a data structure and data library that can be modified by users to suit their needs.

Memorativa uses lenses to organize content within a memory palace. One function of the lens is to provide a symbolic overview of the palace. 

Natal charts (horoscopes) are used to identify and categorize content according to astrological attributes, such as the user's natal chart, the chart of an event, a time or place submitted or associated with the content, the actual creation date and location of the content, and the user's current or past location. Content can be categorized according to attributes that map to houses, planets, aspects, and other symbolic patterns. Further, the app uses real-time astronomical data and calculations to identify and categorize content based on the analysis of natal and mundane charts, including planetary aspects, planetary stations, and planetary hours, celestial bodies, and lunar phases. This analysis can passively applied to content associated with news, world events, and trending topics, and can also be used to identify and categorize content based on the user's current or past location.

Each entry into the memory palace can be analyzed by the user according to a chosen divinatory method such as tarot, astrology, i-ching, or other esoteric frameworks. The results of the operation are automatically stored and displayed in the memory palace. The user can then search for content based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns based on the outcomes. Different entries can be combined and analyzed to create a deeper symbolic understanding of the content.

The app uses a custom data model that users can export, edit, and modify. Users should be able to easily add their own types of symbolic lenses from other esoteric or symbolic frameworks.

NSFW content can be added so as not to disallow artistic expression or private curation of personal content, but is always private and can never be shared or distributed. Further, content will be still be moderated by the app using AI tools to remove any illegal, explicit, or pornographic content. Similar certain words and links will also be removed by the app.
