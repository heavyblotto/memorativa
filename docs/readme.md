## The Art of Memory
The DMP is based on **the art of memory**, which is an ancient collection of methods for storing, organizing, and retrieving memories using 
imaginative and symbolic mental representations.
  - The DMP adopts a digital form of the astrological memory system of **Marsilio Ficino**, which is a dynamic system that uses the positions of the sun, moon, and planets to organize and categorize content.
  - Each DMP contains **halls**, which are the rooms or spatial representation of the memory palace:
    - Solar hall (default view): overall view of the memory palace and its contents.
    - Lunar hall: personal content collections.
    - Mercury hall: communications and learning.
    - Venus hall: aesthetics, art, music, movies, media.
    - Mars hall: active practice.
    - Jupiter hall: teaching materials.
    - Saturn hall: historical archives.
    - Fixed Stars hall: Zodiacal organization of universal principles.
    - Earth hall: hall of natal chart interactions.
  - Halls contain **houses**, which are 12 distinct zones within the hall based on the astrological memory system of **Marsilio Ficino**.
    - houses are arranged in a circle encompassing the walls of the hall.
  - The DMP uses an adopted digital form of the **method of loci**, which is a collection of methods for storing, organizing, and retrieving memories using physical objects and spaces within the halls and houses of the DMP.
  - Each section of the hall is visually and dynamically influenced by the movement of the **archetypes**, which are the dynamic planetary influences used by **Marsilio Ficino**.

## Lenses
**Lenses** are symbolic curation algorithms based on different symbolic systems and that are applied by users to filter, relate, and surface content based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns related to the content.

The lens is defined by a data structure and data library that can be modified by users to suit their needs.

## Use cases
1. Users submit content via a link or a URL. Flow: 
    - I'm on X.com and I bookmark a post. I then submit the bookmark to the app. 
    The app uses AI to extract the content from the bookmark and then stores it in the memory palace.
    - I go to my memory palace and I see the the content I submitted in the Sun hall (default view).
    - As I navigate through the memory palace, I can see the content I submitted in the context of the memory palace.
2. Users use different halls in the memory palace to explore the content in different ways:
    - Solar hall (default view): overall view of the memory palace and its contents.
    - Lunar hall: personal content collections.
    - Mercury hall: reference connections.
    - Venus hall: aesthetic attributes.
    - Mars hall: active practice records.
    - Jupiter hall: teaching materials.
    - Saturn hall: historical archives.
4. Users cultivate a memory palace that curates ideas, notes, media and other content, while simultaneously navigating through a universe of symbolic lenses that provide a deeper symbolic understanding of the content.
5. Users level-up the memory palace architecture to suit their needs.
7. Users use notations, analysis, and divinatory methods to analyze the content and gain a deeper symbolic understanding of the content.
8. Users customize lenses and behavior of the memory palace to suit their needs.
9. Memorativa notifies users of astrological events and planetary hours, and can automatically add content to the memory palace based on the astrological events and planetary hours.
10. User consults their content inventory and can see all of the content they have submitted to the memory palace, sorted by keyword, title,submission date, tags,category, method, platform, and other metadata.

## Memory Palaces
Users create a memory palace that curates ideas, notes, media and other content, while simultaneously navigating through a universe of symbolic lenses that provide a deeper symbolic understanding of the content. The application's core architecture integrates traditional memory palace techniques (method of loci) with dynamic symbolic influences (by default, Ficino's astrological memory system) to create a living space where content can be stored, explored, and shared.

The memory palace architecture is one of great halls. The halls appear as ancient, fabled, mythological, historical, or modern structures, but they all share a common theme: the ability to curate and store content in a way that is both symbolic and intuitive. 

Users add content (links) to the memory palace, and the memory palace automatically curates and organizes the content based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns it extracts and stores from the content. Furnishings, themes, and decorations can also be acquired and added to the palace to further enhance the symbolic experience. Such acquisitions can be unlocked based on the achievements and participation of the user in the palace. The app will use AI to generate the symbolic images for the furnishings, themes, and decorations.

### Content
Content would typically be submitted manually (add a link) or automatically generated when a user on X.com bookmarks or shares a post, as one example.  A user would link and authorize their X account and then be able to add content to the palace. The link would then be stored and automatically organized and curated in a memory palace, based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns. Similarly, the content from the link (news, blog, tweet, video, etc.) would be analyzed, extracted to text and metadata, represented as data, and then stored and automatically curated in a memory palace, based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns.

### Lenses
Memorativa uses lenses to organize content within a memory palace. Astrological lens is the primary organizational pattern. One function of the lens is to provide a symbolic overview of the palace. Natal charts (horoscopes) are used to identify and categorize content, such as the user's natal chart, the chart of an event, a time or place submitted or associated with the content, the actual creation date and location of the content, and the user's current or past location. Content can be categorized according to attributes that map to houses, planets, aspects, and other symbolic patterns. Further, the app uses real-time astronomical data and calculations to identify and categorize content based on the analysis of natal and mundane charts, including planetary aspects, planetary stations, and planetary hours, celestial bodies, and lunar phases. This analysis can passively applied to content associated with news, world events, and trending topics, and can also be used to identify and categorize content based on the user's current or past location.

Each entry into the memory palace can be analyzed by the user according to a chosen divinatory method such as tarot, astrology, i-ching, or other esoteric frameworks. The results of the operation are automatically stored and displayed in the memory palace. The user can then search for content based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns based on the outcomes. Different entries can be combined and analyzed to create a deeper symbolic understanding of the content.

The app uses a custom data model that users can export, edit, and modify. Users should be able to easily add their own types of symbolic lenses from other esoteric or symbolic frameworks.

NSFW content can be added so as not to disallow artistic expression or private curation of personal content, but is always private and can never be shared or distributed. Further, content will be still be moderated by the app using AI tools to remove any illegal, explicit, or pornographic content. Similar certain words and links will also be removed by the app.

## Memory Palace Architecture
The memory palace architecture consists of a main Sun hall--a central chamber--and a series of rooms that radiate from the central chamber. Each room is named after a planet, with the main Sun hall serving as the central hub. The Sun hall provides an overview of the palace and its contents, while the other rooms provide further exploration and organization of the content. The planets are arranged in a circle around the walls of the hall, with portals connecting to the rooms.

Overlaying the hall are the astrological houses, which further categorize the content and define the room structure. Further overlaying the hall are the thematic influences of the Ficino system, such as the planetary influences, which further categorize the content and define the room structure. By default, content added to the memory palace is automatically placed in the Sun hall, but the user can also organize and find content in other rooms.

The system uniquely combines two powerful traditional approaches:
- The dynamic celestial framework of Marsilio Ficino's astrological memory system
- The concrete spatial techniques of the classical Art of Memory

This hybrid approach enables:
- Physical memory palaces that respond to celestial influences
- Traditional loci enhanced by planetary energies
- Fixed architectural spaces with dynamic symbolic meanings
- Concrete memory storage with fluid organizational patterns
- Stable navigation paths that reveal different aspects under varying conditions

### House-Based Sections
