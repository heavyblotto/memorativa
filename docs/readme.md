# Memorativa - Cross-System Symbolic Correspondence Engine

## Vision
Memorativa is a dynamic application designed to explore and reveal the interconnected nature of esoteric symbolic systems across cultures and traditions. Through personalized memory palaces and intuitive symbolic lenses, users can discover symbolic connections between different metaphysical frameworks.

Users create a memory palace that curates ideas, notes, media and other content, while simultaneously navigating through a universe of symbolic lenses that provide a deeper symbolic understanding of the content. The application's core architecture integrates traditional memory palace techniques (method of loci) with dynamic celestial influences (Ficino's astrological memory system) to create a living space where content can be stored, explored, and shared.

The palace architecture supports the method of loci, while the default lens is the Astrological lens using Ficino's astrological memory system. The Astrological lens provides a symbolic overview of the palace, while the user can switch to other lenses to gain a deeper symbolic understanding of the content.

The memory palace architecture is one of great halls. The halls may appear as ancient, fabled, mythological, historical, or modern structures, but they all share a common theme: the ability to curate and store content in a way that is both symbolic and intuitive. Users can add content to the palace, and the palace can automatically curate and organize the content based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns. Furnishings, themes, and decorations can also be acquired and added to the palace to further enhance the symbolic experience. Such acquisitions can be unlocked based on the achievements and participation of the user in the palace (using gamification).

Content would typically be submitted manually (add a link) or automatically generated when a user on X.com bookmarks or shares a post, as one example.  A user would link and authorize their X account and then be able to add content to the palace. The link would then be stored and automatically organized and curated in a memory palace, based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns. Similarly, the content from the link (news, blog, tweet, video, etc.) would be analyzed, extracted to text and metadata, represented as data, and then stored and automatically curated in a memory palace, based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns.

Memorativa uses lenses to organize content within a memory palace. Astrological lens is the primary organizational pattern. One function of the lens is to provide a symbolic overview of the palace. Natal charts (horoscopes) are used to identify and categorize content, such as the user's natal chart, the chart of an event, a time or place submitted or associated with the content, the actual creation date and location of the content, and the user's current or past location. Content can be categorized according to attributes that map to houses, planets, aspects, and other symbolic patterns. Further, the app uses real-time astonomical data and calculations to identify and categorize content based on the analysis of natal and mundane charts, including planetary aspects, planetary stations, and planetary hours, celestial bodies, and lunar phases. This analysis can passively applied to content associated with news, world events, and trending topics, and can also be used to identify and categorize content based on the user's current or past location.

Each entry into the memory palace can be analyzed by the user according to a chosen divinatory method such as tarot, astrology, i-ching, or other esoteric frameworks. The results of the operation are automatically stored and displayed in the memory palace. The user can then search for content based on various symbolic patterns, relationships, and organizational patterns based on the outcomes. Different entries can be combined and analyzed to create a deeper symbolic understanding of the content.

The app uses a custom data model that users can export, edit, and modify. Users should be able to easily add their own types of symbolic lenses from other esoteric or symbolic frameworks.

NSFW content can be added so as not to disallow artistic expression or private curation of personal content, but is always private and can never be shared or distibuted. Further, content will be still be moderated by the app using AI tools to remove any illegal, explicit, or pornographic content. Similar certain words and links will also be removed by the app.

## Palace Architecture
The palace architecture consists of a main Sun hall--a central chamber--and a series of rooms that radiate from the central chamber. Each room is named after a planet, with the main Sun hall serving as the central hub. The Sun hall provides an overview of the palace and its contents, while the other rooms provide further exploration and organization of the content. The planets are arranged in a circle around the walls of the hall, with portals connecting to the rooms.

Overlaying the hall are the astrological houses, which further categorize the content and define the room structure. Further overlaying the hall are the thematic influences of the Ficino system, such as the planetary influences, which further categorize the content and define the room structure. By default, content added to the memory palace is automatically placed in the Sun hall, but the user can also organize and find content in other rooms.

#### House-Based Sections
- **Twelve Primary Zones**
  - Each house manifests as a distinct functional area
  - Thematic alignment with traditional house meanings
  - Flexible boundaries responding to house cusps
  - Interactive zones for content placement
  - Passage points to extended rooms

#### Ficinian Dynamism
- **Planetary Influences**
  - Real-time celestial energy mapping
  - Dynamic color and lighting shifts
  - Live wallpaper effects
  - Temporal effect variations
  - Aspect-based interactions
  - Local manifestation of planetary qualities

The memory palace would then be accessible through a user interface, displaying the content in a specific lens, such as a Kabbalistic lens or a Vedic lens.
