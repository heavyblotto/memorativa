# Digital Memory Palace Design

## Core Architecture

### Hall Structure
Each hall is designed as an 12-sided chamber with a soaring ceiling and a vertical organization system:

- **Vertical Organization**
  - New entries appear at ceiling level
  - Content flows downward over time
  - Ground level is the present
  - Floor level represents past times below or future times above
  - Dynamic column generation based on content patterns
  - Column types:
    - Hanging tapestries for narrative content
    - Crystal columns for structured data
    - Living vines for evolving content
    - Stone pillars for foundational material
    - Light beams for trending content
    - Water columns for fluid/changing content
    - Dynamic bookshelf columns for concepts and categories
    - Paintings columns for visual content

- **Central Atrium**
  - Towering central space with celestial dome
  - Design is based on horoscope
  - Dome shows zodiac signs and constellations
  - Walls represent the 12 houses
  - Planets positions can be tracked on the dome and the walls
  - Planetary influences affect the content, architecture, furnishings, and fixtures of the houses
  - Connecting vertical levels

- **House Demarcations**
  - Twelve vertical walls
  - Each house section contains its own column arrangements
  - Columns respect house boundaries but can span multiple houses
  - Walls can grow and shrink or be adjusted based on content density

- **Content Flow Mechanics**
  - New entries materialize at ceiling level
  - Content descends based on:
    - Age
    - Relevance
    - Usage patterns
    - Planetary influences
  - Archive level features:
    - Historical displays
    - View the history of the content as it flows through the hall.
    - View the DMP from a given point in time.

- **Dynamic Elements**
  - Columns appear/disappear based on content volume
  - Column width adjusts to content importance
  - Column height reflects content depth
  - Visual treatments change with planetary hours
  - 
- - **Dynamic Organization**
  - Labels and identifiers float near content
  - Metadata appears on hover
  - Related items glow when selected
  - Content groupings form visual patterns
  - Navigation markers show:
    - Access frequency
    - Last viewed
    - Related content
    - Update status

- **Column Interactions**
  - Hover reveals detailed metadata
  - Click expands content preview
  - Drag reorders content
  - Gesture controls for:
    - Grouping related items
    - Creating new collections
    - Archiving old content
    - Highlighting important items

### House Organization

Houses manifest differently based on each hall's planetary nature:

#### Solar Hall Houses
- 1st House: Bright entrance portal (identity)
- 2nd House: Treasury room (resources)
- 3rd House: Communication center (connections)
- 4th House: Foundation chamber (origins)
- 5th House: Creative studio (expression)
- 6th House: Workshop (practice)
- 7th House: Meeting hall (relationships)
- 8th House: Transformation chamber (research)
- 9th House: Library (knowledge)
- 10th House: Achievement gallery (career)
- 11th House: Community space (networks)
- 12th House: Meditation room (private)

#### Lunar Hall Houses
- Same 12 sections but with:
  - Reflective surfaces
  - Water features representing emotional content
  - Appearances that change with lunar phases
  - Mood-based content organization
