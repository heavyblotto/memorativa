# Memorativa MVP Design

## Introduction

At its core, Memorativa is:
- A content organization system using archetypal houses as an intuitive classification framework
- A game that rewards thoughtful content curation and relationship building
- A tool for discovering meaningful patterns and connections in personal knowledge
- A platform that grows in interpretive depth as users engage with it

Glass Beads are the rewards and the game. Each bead begins as a simple content link in one of twelve intuitive categories, then transforms as you discover relationships and meaning. The beads are visual representations of your thinking, showing connections, patterns, and deeper understanding as they evolve. The game recognizes patterns in your collected beads and presents quests and synchronicity challenges that make knowledge organization feel like an unfolding adventure. Playing the free version reveals basic patterns and connections, while premium unlocks additional ways to interpret and connect your growing collection of thought artifacts. Your Glass Beads evolve visually alongside your understanding, creating a living map of meaning that grows richer with every move you make. This isn't just a filing system pretending to be fun - it's a game where your thoughts come alive.

The system presents opportunities, connections, and insights in an intuitive way that feels natural to how humans think about and organize information. 

The system rewards users with Glass Beads ("Proof of Thinking" tokens) for meaningful content organization, relationship discovery, and pattern recognition. This gamification aspect isn't merely superficial - it's designed to encourage the kind of associative thinking and pattern recognition that leads to genuine insights and knowledge synthesis.
