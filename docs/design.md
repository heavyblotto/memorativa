# Memorativa: a game of glass beads and memory houses

# I. System Overview

## Introduction

> Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.

Humans are animals who think, using both reason and imagination. The products of  thinking activity are ideas and concepts.

A working model for thought(1):

1. What a concept is cannot be expressed in words. Words can do no more than draw our attention to the fact that we have concepts. 

2. When someone perceives a tree or a memory, the perception acts as a stimulus for thought.

3. Thus an **ideal element** is added to the perceived object, and the perceiver regards the object and its ideal complement as belonging together. 

4. When the object disappears from the field of his perception, the ideal counterpart alone remains. 

5. This remaining ideal counterpart is the concept of the object. 

6. The wider the range of our experience, the larger becomes the number of our concepts. 

7. Moreover, concepts are not by any means found in isolation one from the other. They combine to form an ordered and systematic whole. 

8. The concept “organism,” e.g., combines with those of “development according to law,” “growth,” and others. 

9. Other concepts based on particular objects fuse completely with one another.

10. All concepts formed from particular lions fuse in the universal concept “lion.” 

11. In this way, all the separate concepts combine to form a closed, conceptual system within which each has its special place. 

12. Ideas do not differ qualitatively from concepts. They are but fuller, more saturated, more comprehensive concepts. 

With this "mental model", we can design a system that reflects this inner ecosystem of thinking, so that we may be better regard and attend to this "systematic whole" that serves as our interior cosmos.

### Content

Content is understood as a consumable unit of "something" represented online. Consumption is akin to eating, digesting, and excreting. Anything consumed is processed automatically, without conscious awareness.  

### Symbols

Humans can chose to consume or to perceive.

- A symbol is a mark, sign, or word that represents an idea, object, or relationship. 

- Symbols can be used to create connections between different concepts and experiences. 

- Symbols both reveal and conceal at once.

- Symbols serve as a bridge between the conscious and unconscious mind, and also as a ferment and muse for the development of new concepts and ideas.

- Symbols can deepen, widen, and enrich the complimentary "ideal element" that arises from the perception of an object.

- Symbolic systems and languages can help rarify and clarify the process of thinking that generates concepts and ideas.

### The ideal element, relationships, and analogy

The mysteriousness of the ideal element remains a topic to be explored, as does the formation of percepts, concepts, ideas, and memories. Regardless of the metaphysical nature or knowability of the ideal element as a process or even itself a concept, its use can be treated as a human capacity related to memory and imagination. Love, or the attraction between two objects, can be an analogy of the mysteriousness of the mechanism and calling forth of the ideal element.

Relationships between objects can arise because we can perceive (internally) something of the "ideal element" between them. This perception of a conceptual relationship is the key to all analogical thinking. Pattern recognition depends on a foundational perception of the "ideal element" between objects.

Analogy presumes the knowability of the unknown.

- The procedure of classification of objects on the basis of their resemblance is the first step on the way of research by the inductive method.

- Analogy (argument by analogy) can constitute the basis of hypothesis.

- Scientific method, indeed, is mainly devoted to discovering means of so heightening the known analogy that we may dispense as far as possible with the methods of pure induction(2)

### Social media

The current social media model collects "content" from users but prioritizes the maximization of various metrics based on various definitions of engagement. Because the system monetizes user content, users become stuck in roles that simply perform to maximize engagement, regardless of the meaning, value, intent, or worth of the content.

This is not to say that interesting content is not created or available:

- Symbols arises from people who, rather than react to content, chose to think, produce new ideas, and then artistically reflect the concept that arose form the initial content.

- Other signs or tokens that represent memories, placeholders for future ideas and other concepts, art, and previously unknown facts, concepts, and ideas are also available.

But two issues remain with the social media model:

- The system is also designed for you not to reflect on the content, but to react to it.
- The content is not discoverable nor workable.

By workable, we mean that social media models are mostly centered around a dynamic feed of content, which is not conducive to meaningful reflection but dopamine hits.

In contrast, an opportunity presents for a system that is designed to cultivate an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships. 

Such a system would use the raw material of content, liberating it from the social media model to create a workshop of ideas, concepts, and relationships.

Such work requires: 

- a space
- tools
- a playful approach

Such play may be facilitated by:

- a system of symbols
- a system of rules
- a system of rewards

**Memorativa** is the name of the system.

### Ars Memorativa

The art of memory (Latin: *ars memoriae*) is any of a number of loosely associated mnemonic principles and techniques used to organize memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. An alternative term is "Ars Memorativa" which is also translated as "art of memory" although its more literal meaning is "Memorative Art".(3)

Memorativa takes inspiration from this ancient art, especially with regard to "the combination and 'invention' of ideas".

Within Memorativa, **Memory houses** are the spaces where the game is played.

### The computer, AI, and automated thinking

Even now the world has moved on from social media and into the age of AI. Memorativa is not here to challenge or debate the merits of AI, but in fact use it to its advantage.

A word of caution will be given concerning the automation of thinking. One can discern from social media, AI, and general trends going back to Newton, that our thinking (reasoning and imagination) can be easily externalized in exchange for speed and efficiency. One can also perceive that externalized thinking can be an effort to capture the "ideal element" for the machines.

Memorativa is a remedial trend towards human thinking and an hygienic force in the culture. 

### The Glass Bead Game

Author Hermann Hesse's novel *The Glass Bead Game* (1943) is a fictionalized account of a game of memory and imagination. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics. Though alluded to, the game is never fully described.(4)

Memorativa takes inspiration from The Glass Bead Game.

Within Memorativa, **Glass Beads** are game tokens that represent ideas, concepts, and relationships. **The Glass Bead Game** are the rules and play of the system.

2. **Memory Houses**: Working with tools within a visualized space where content is worked on to produce new ideas, concepts, and relationships.
3. **The Glass Bead Game**: A game that rewards the player for their thinking and creativity.
4. **The Idolum**: An "agent" (powered by an engine) that uses symbolic systems and AI to surface, find, and illuminate new ideas, concepts, relationships.
5. **Symbolic lenses**: Symbolic lenses that apply different symbolic systems to the play.
6. **Glass Beads**: Game tokens are awarded and used for play and that represent and encode ideas, concepts, and relationships, as well as Proof of Human Thought (PoHT).
