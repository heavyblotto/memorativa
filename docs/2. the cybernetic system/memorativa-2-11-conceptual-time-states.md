# 2.11. Conceptual time states

## Introduction

While percept-triplets effectively encode concepts in a spatial framework, adding temporal dimensions provides richer analytical capabilities. This document introduces the concept of time vectors and how they integrate with the percept-triplet model, enabling various representations of time from concrete timestamps to indeterminate states [1]. These conceptual time states create a flexible framework for temporal analysis while maintaining compatibility with the visualization approach described in document 2.10.

## Main Content

Percept-triplets do not require a time vector to successfully encode a percept + concept into a prototype, but a time vector can be added to the percept-triplet to represent conceptual time states:

- **Mundane time state**: a past or future timestamp that relates to the percept, such as the time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept, or an imagined future date related to an imagined future event
- **Quantum time state**: a conceptual state of indeterminate or no time, or immeasurable present time
- **Holographic time state**: a conceptual time state paired with a percept that is attuned to a reference time, such as a natal chart

### Encoded percept-triplet vectors + time states

The percept-triplet model with the addition of conceptual time state vectors expands the encoding to include temporal dimensions.

With the addition of the conceptual time vector to a percept-triplet, the concept can be placed exactly in time and space on the chart. One example of a time vector is using the time-date stamp of the entry of the input to the Memorativa system (capturing a mundane time state).

Without the time state vector, the percept-triplet remains in an indefinite *quantum state*. The quantum time state enables the "tuning" of the placement of the imaginary planet by opportunistically calculating its placement based on potential angular relationships with other planets or nodes.

Holographic time states connect superimposed charts across time states (past to past, past to future, past to conceptual, conceptual to conceptual, etc.) by using a reference chart against one or more superimposed charts. The reference chart becomes useful when superimposed charts that have no time vector and hence no actual degree location can be "tuned" to find a related, instantiated location with a degree.

### Conceptual time state vectors

| **Time State**          | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mundane Time State**   | Represents a specific timestamp (past or future) related to the concept        | The time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept |
| **Quantum Time State**   | Represents an indeterminate or immeasurable present time                       | A concept that exists outside of linear time, such as a memory or dream     |
| **Holographic Time State** | Represents a conceptual time state attuned to a reference time (e.g., a natal chart) | Superimposing a natal chart with a transit chart to analyze daily events in reference to personal meaning |

The percept-triplet model with conceptual time state vectors encodes 6 primary vectors (3 percept-triplet + 3 time state) and hundreds of sub-vectors when considering the multiple correlations, modes, domains, and temporal dimensions within each primary vector [2]. The exact number depends on the depth of analysis for each planet, sign, house, and time state.

In the context of the structure of the prototype, it is possible for each percept-triplet to have the same or different conceptual time states.

The Memorativa temporal state model allows for richer temporal and conceptual analysis, enabling the system to encode percepts with both spatial and temporal dimensions.

### Vector encoding

The percept-triplet model with conceptual time state vectors encodes 6 primary vectors (3 percept-triplet + 3 time state) and hundreds of sub-vectors when considering the multiple correlations, modes, domains, and temporal dimensions within each primary vector [2]. The exact number depends on the depth of analysis for each planet, sign, house, and time state.

Each percept-triplet can have independent time states, allowing for flexible temporal relationships within the prototype structure [3].

### Privacy-preserving time states

Each time state now implements privacy preservation with dynamic noise balancing:

- **Public data**: Minimal noise added (preserves utility while providing basic anonymization)
- **Private data**: Maximum noise applied (prioritizes privacy over precision)
- **Mixed sensitivity**: Adaptive noise levels based on context and user preferences

This approach uses differential privacy techniques to ensure that temporal patterns remain detectable for analysis while specific timestamps are obfuscated with appropriate levels of protection [3].

The noise calibration ensures that statistical properties are preserved at the aggregate level while individual data points receive protection proportional to their sensitivity.

### Privacy-Preserving Time States Implementation

```rust
struct PrivateTemporalStates {
    mundane: Option<PrivateDateTime>,    // Privacy-preserving timestamp
    quantum: PrivateQuantumState,        // Protected conceptual time
    holographic: Option<PrivateChartRef>, // Private reference alignment
    privacy_level: PrivacyLevel          // Controls noise intensity
}

impl PrivateTemporalStates {
    fn calculate_temporal_weight(&self) -> Result<f32> {
        // Add calibrated noise to temporal calculations
        match self {
            Some(mundane) => {
                let base_weight = compute_private_mundane_weight(mundane);
                apply_noise_by_privacy_level(base_weight, self.privacy_level)
            },
            None => self.quantum.get_private_conceptual_weight()
        }
    }
    
    fn apply_noise_by_privacy_level(&self, value: f32, level: PrivacyLevel) -> f32 {
        // Balance noise based on privacy level
        let epsilon = match level {
            PrivacyLevel::Public => 1.0,     // Minimal noise
            PrivacyLevel::Protected => 0.5,  // Moderate noise
            PrivacyLevel::Private => 0.1     // Maximum noise
        };
        
        // Apply Laplace noise calibrated to sensitivity
        value + generate_laplace_noise(epsilon)
    }
}
```

### State transition rules

#### Quantum to Mundane Transitions
- Occurs when a quantum state concept gets anchored to a specific timestamp [4]
- Requires either:
  - User explicitly setting a timestamp
  - System detecting temporal reference in content
  - Pattern matching with existing mundane events
- Preserves original quantum properties as metadata

#### Mundane to Quantum Transitions  
- Occurs when temporal specificity needs to be relaxed
- Triggered by:
  - Pattern analysis requiring temporal flexibility
  - User removing timestamp
  - Merging multiple mundane states into a conceptual pattern
- Maintains link to original mundane timestamp as reference

### Quantum-Inspired Temporal Analysis

```rust
struct QuantumInspiredTemporalState {
    // State vector representing temporal superposition
    state_vector: StateVector,
    
    fn analyze_temporal_patterns(&self) -> TemporalPattern {
        // Simulate quantum walk on temporal states [4]
        let walk = QuantumWalk::new(self.state_vector);
        
        walk.evolve(STEPS)
            .measure_distribution()
            .extract_pattern()
    }
}
```

### State Transition Implementation

```rust
struct StateTransition {
    from_state: TimeState,
    to_state: TimeState,
    transition_rules: Vec<TransitionRule>,
    metadata: TransitionMetadata,

    fn validate_transition(&self) -> Result<bool> {
        self.transition_rules.iter()
            .all(|rule| rule.check(self.from_state, self.to_state))
    }

    fn execute(&self) -> Result<TimeState> {
        if !self.validate_transition()? {
            return Err(TransitionError::InvalidTransition);
        }
        self.apply_transition() // Updates weights based on backpropagation [5]
    }
}
```

## Temporal State Tokenomics

The manipulation and analysis of time states within the Memorativa system consumes computational resources, which are accounted for using the Gas Bead Token (GBT) economy [6]. Time vectors add significant analytical capability but require corresponding computational resources.

### Time State Operation Costs

| Operation | GBT Cost | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Time Vector Addition | 3-6 GBT | Adding a time vector to an existing percept-triplet |
| Mundane State Timestamping | 2-4 GBT | Concrete timestamp assignment |
| Quantum State Manipulation | 5-10 GBT | Operations on indeterminate time states |
| Holographic Reference Creation | 8-12 GBT | Establishing temporal reference frames |
| State Transition | 4-7 GBT | Converting between different time states |
| Temporal Pattern Analysis | 10-15 GBT | Identifying patterns across time states |
| Privacy-Preserving Time Encoding | +50% to base cost | Additional cost for enhanced privacy operations |

### Token Rewards for Temporal Contributions

Players earn GBT when their temporal operations contribute value to the knowledge network:

- Establishing meaningful temporal connections between concepts (3-8 GBT)
- Creating useful temporal reference frames (5-10 GBT)
- Identifying significant temporal patterns (7-15 GBT)
- Contributing to temporal analysis algorithms (10-25 GBT)

This token economy creates a self-sustaining system where computational resources for temporal operations are balanced with rewards for valuable temporal insights, encouraging thoughtful consideration of temporal relationships rather than arbitrary timestamping [6].

### Implementation

```rust
struct TemporalTokenCalculator {
    base_operation_cost: u32,
    privacy_multiplier: f32,
    complexity_factor: f32,
    
    fn calculate_operation_cost(&self, operation: TimeOperation, privacy_level: PrivacyLevel) -> u32 {
        let base_cost = match operation {
            TimeOperation::AddVector => 4,
            TimeOperation::Timestamp => 3,
            TimeOperation::QuantumManipulation => 7,
            TimeOperation::HolographicReference => 10,
            TimeOperation::StateTransition => 5,
            TimeOperation::PatternAnalysis => 12,
        };
        
        let privacy_factor = match privacy_level {
            PrivacyLevel::Public => 1.0,
            PrivacyLevel::Protected => 1.25,
            PrivacyLevel::Private => 1.5
        };
        
        (base_cost as f32 * privacy_factor * self.complexity_factor) as u32
    }
    
    fn calculate_reward(&self, contribution: TemporalContribution) -> u32 {
        match contribution.value_assessment() {
            ContributionValue::Minimal => 2,
            ContributionValue::Standard => 5,
            ContributionValue::Significant => 10,
            ContributionValue::Exceptional => 20
        }
    }
}
```

## Operational Costs

The implementation of conceptual time states introduces specific computational and memory requirements that must be carefully managed for efficient performance. This section analyzes the operational costs of time state operations and provides optimization strategies.

### Time Vector Computation

Time vector operations have the following computational complexity:

1. **Time State Creation**: O(1) for individual state creation
   - Mundane time state creation: O(1)
   - Quantum time state initialization: O(1)
   - Holographic time state reference: O(1)

2. **Time Vector Assignment**:
   - Assigning time vector to percept-triplet: O(1)
   - Batch assignment to prototype: O(p) where p is the number of percept-triplets
   - Time vector validation: O(1)

3. **State Transition Operations**:
   - State transition calculation: O(r) where r is the number of transition rules
   - Transition validation: O(r)
   - Backpropagation weight updates: O(w) where w is the number of weights

4. **Time-based Pattern Analysis**:
   - Temporal pattern detection: O(p log p) for pattern sorting and grouping
   - Quantum walk simulation: O(s * p) where s is the number of steps
   - Temporal coherence analysis: O(p²) for all triplet pairs

The most computationally intensive operations are the quantum-inspired temporal pattern analysis (O(p log p)) and temporal coherence analysis (O(p²)) when dealing with complex prototypes containing many triplets.

### Memory Requirements

Memory usage for time state operations scales with several key components:

```python
# Memory usage per time state
mem_per_time_state = (
    base_time_state_overhead +      # Time state metadata (typically 4-8KB)
    mundane_timestamp_memory +      # Mundane timestamp data (16-32 bytes)
    quantum_state_vector_memory +   # Quantum state vector (varies, typically 1-2KB)
    holographic_reference_memory +  # Holographic reference data (500-1000 bytes)
    privacy_preserving_noise_data + # Differential privacy metadata (100-200 bytes)
    transition_rules_memory +       # Transition rules (50-100 bytes per rule)
    temporal_pattern_cache          # Pattern cache (varies, ~5KB)
)

# Estimated total for typical time state implementation
typical_time_state_memory = 10KB + (p * 0.5KB) + (r * 0.1KB)
```

For a standard prototype with 20 percept-triplets and 15 transition rules:
- Base time state data: ~10KB
- Percept-triplet time vectors: ~10KB
- Transition rules: ~1.5KB
- Privacy-preserving metadata: ~2KB
- Total: ~23.5KB per prototype

For multi-prototype temporal analysis with 5 concurrent prototypes:
- Base memory: ~117.5KB
- Shared temporal pattern cache: ~15KB
- Total: ~132.5KB

### Optimization Strategies

Several time state-specific optimization techniques can significantly improve performance:

1. **Lazy state transitions** delay computation until needed:
   ```rust
   // Only compute state transitions when accessed
   struct LazyStateTransition {
       from_state: TimeState,
       to_state: Option<TimeState>,
       transition_rules: Vec<TransitionRule>,
       computed: bool,
   }
   
   impl LazyStateTransition {
       fn get_to_state(&mut self) -> TimeState {
           if !self.computed {
               self.to_state = Some(self.compute_transition());
               self.computed = true;
           }
           self.to_state.unwrap()
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Time vector caching** for repeated operations:
   ```rust
   // Cache time vector calculations
   struct TimeVectorCache {
       cache: HashMap<TimeVectorKey, TimeVector>,
   }
   
   impl TimeVectorCache {
       fn get(&mut self, key: TimeVectorKey) -> TimeVector {
           if !self.cache.contains_key(&key) {
               let vector = compute_time_vector(&key);
               self.cache.insert(key, vector);
           }
           self.cache.get(&key).unwrap().clone()
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Quantum state compression** for efficient storage:
   ```rust
   // Compress quantum state vectors to reduce memory usage
   fn compress_quantum_state(state: &QuantumState) -> CompressedState {
       // Only store non-zero amplitudes
       let significant_amplitudes = state.amplitudes
           .iter()
           .filter(|(_, &amp)| amp.abs() > THRESHOLD)
           .map(|(idx, amp)| (*idx, *amp))
           .collect();
       
       CompressedState {
           significant_amplitudes,
           dimension: state.dimension,
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Adaptive privacy noise** based on sensitivity:
   ```rust
   // Apply adaptive noise based on data sensitivity
   fn apply_privacy_noise(value: f32, sensitivity: PrivacySensitivity) -> f32 {
       let epsilon = match sensitivity {
           PrivacySensitivity::Low => 1.0,
           PrivacySensitivity::Medium => 0.5,
           PrivacySensitivity::High => 0.1,
       };
       
       value + generate_laplace_noise(1.0/epsilon)
   }
   ```

5. **Progressive temporal analysis** for complex patterns:
   ```rust
   // Perform temporal analysis in stages
   async fn analyze_temporal_patterns(prototype: &Prototype) -> TemporalPatterns {
       // First analyze simple patterns
       let simple_patterns = analyze_simple_patterns(prototype).await;
       
       // Then medium complexity patterns
       let medium_patterns = analyze_medium_patterns(prototype, &simple_patterns).await;
       
       // Finally complex patterns
       let complex_patterns = analyze_complex_patterns(prototype, &medium_patterns).await;
       
       combine_patterns(simple_patterns, medium_patterns, complex_patterns)
   }
   ```

### Memory Optimization

For better memory efficiency in time state management:

1. **Shared transition rule libraries** reduce duplication:
   ```rust
   // Use shared transition rule definitions
   struct SharedTransitionRules {
       rule_library: HashMap<TransitionRuleId, TransitionRule>,
   }
   
   impl SharedTransitionRules {
       fn get_rule(&self, id: TransitionRuleId) -> &TransitionRule {
           self.rule_library.get(&id).unwrap()
       }
       
       fn get_rules(&self, ids: &[TransitionRuleId]) -> Vec<&TransitionRule> {
           ids.iter()
              .map(|id| self.get_rule(*id))
              .collect()
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Time state pooling** for similar states:
   ```rust
   // Pool similar time states to reduce memory usage
   struct TimeStatePool {
       quantum_states: HashMap<QuantumStateHash, Rc<QuantumTimeState>>,
       mundane_states: HashMap<MundaneTimeHash, Rc<MundaneTimeState>>,
       holographic_states: HashMap<HolographicHash, Rc<HolographicTimeState>>,
   }
   
   impl TimeStatePool {
       fn get_quantum_state(&mut self, state: QuantumTimeState) -> Rc<QuantumTimeState> {
           let hash = state.hash();
           if !self.quantum_states.contains_key(&hash) {
               self.quantum_states.insert(hash, Rc::new(state));
           }
           Rc::clone(self.quantum_states.get(&hash).unwrap())
       }
       
       // Similar methods for mundane and holographic states
   }
   ```

3. **Incremental state updates**:
   ```rust
   // Only update changed components of time states
   struct IncrementalTimeState {
       base_state: TimeState,
       changes: HashMap<TimeStateComponent, ComponentValue>,
   }
   
   impl IncrementalTimeState {
       fn apply_changes(&self) -> TimeState {
           let mut new_state = self.base_state.clone();
           for (component, value) in &self.changes {
               new_state.update_component(*component, value.clone());
           }
           new_state
       }
   }
   ```

### Multi-State Performance

For multi-state analysis scenarios:

1. **Parallel state transitions** for batch processing:
   ```rust
   // Process state transitions in parallel
   fn batch_transition(states: &[TimeState], rules: &[TransitionRule]) -> Vec<TimeState> {
       states.par_iter()
           .map(|state| apply_transition(state, rules))
           .collect()
   }
   ```

2. **Temporal indexing** for efficient retrieval:
   ```rust
   // Index time states for fast retrieval
   struct TemporalIndex {
       mundane_index: BTreeMap<DateTime, Vec<StateRef>>,
       quantum_index: HashMap<QuantumHash, Vec<StateRef>>,
       holographic_index: HashMap<ReferenceChart, Vec<StateRef>>,
   }
   
   impl TemporalIndex {
       fn query_time_range(&self, start: DateTime, end: DateTime) -> Vec<StateRef> {
           self.mundane_index.range(start..=end)
               .flat_map(|(_, states)| states)
               .cloned()
               .collect()
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Batch coherence analysis** for optimization:
   ```rust
   // Analyze temporal coherence in batches
   fn analyze_coherence_batched(states: &[TimeState], batch_size: usize) -> CoherenceResult {
       let mut results = Vec::new();
       
       for batch in states.chunks(batch_size) {
           let batch_result = analyze_batch_coherence(batch);
           results.push(batch_result);
       }
       
       combine_coherence_results(results)
   }
   ```

### Resource Allocation

For optimal time state performance, resources should be allocated as follows:

1. **CPU resources**:
   - 35% for quantum state operations and temporal analysis
   - 25% for state transitions and validation
   - 20% for temporal pattern detection
   - 15% for privacy-preserving noise generation
   - 5% for basic timestamp operations

2. **Memory resources**:
   - 30% for active time state representations
   - 25% for temporal pattern caches
   - 20% for transition rule storage
   - 15% for quantum state vectors
   - 10% for temporal indices

3. **Storage resources**:
   - 40% for persistent time state history
   - 25% for cached temporal patterns
   - 20% for transition logs
   - 10% for reference time frames
   - 5% for operational metadata

This resource allocation ensures the time state system can handle complex temporal operations while maintaining efficient performance across different usage patterns.

## Key Points

- Time vectors extend the percept-triplet model with three distinct temporal states:
  - Mundane time states represent concrete timestamps for real events or perceptions
  - Quantum time states enable flexible, indeterminate temporal representation [4]
  - Holographic time states connect concepts to reference frames for comparative analysis
- The combination of 3 percept-triplet vectors and 3 time state vectors creates a rich spatiotemporal encoding framework [1]
- Time states directly support the visualization approach described in document 2.10, enabling temporal analysis in the chart visualization
- Privacy preservation is implemented at the temporal state level to protect sensitive time information
- State transitions allow concepts to move between different temporal representations as needed for analysis
- Quantum-inspired temporal analysis enables the simultaneous evaluation of multiple time states [4]
- The model supports both exact temporal placement (with time vectors) and opportunistic placement (without time vectors)
- Each percept-triplet can have independent time states, allowing for complex temporal relationships within a prototype [5]
- The token economy balances computational costs with rewards for valuable temporal insights, creating sustainable incentives for temporal analysis [6]

## Code Examples

### Privacy-Preserving Time States Implementation

```rust
struct PrivateTemporalStates {
    mundane: Option<PrivateDateTime>,    // Privacy-preserving timestamp
    quantum: PrivateQuantumState,        // Protected conceptual time
    holographic: Option<PrivateChartRef>, // Private reference alignment
    privacy_level: PrivacyLevel          // Controls noise intensity
}

impl PrivateTemporalStates {
    fn calculate_temporal_weight(&self) -> Result<f32> {
        // Add calibrated noise to temporal calculations
        match self {
            Some(mundane) => {
                let base_weight = compute_private_mundane_weight(mundane);
                apply_noise_by_privacy_level(base_weight, self.privacy_level)
            },
            None => self.quantum.get_private_conceptual_weight()
        }
    }
    
    fn apply_noise_by_privacy_level(&self, value: f32, level: PrivacyLevel) -> f32 {
        // Balance noise based on privacy level
        let epsilon = match level {
            PrivacyLevel::Public => 1.0,     // Minimal noise
            PrivacyLevel::Protected => 0.5,  // Moderate noise
            PrivacyLevel::Private => 0.1     // Maximum noise
        };
        
        // Apply Laplace noise calibrated to sensitivity
        value + generate_laplace_noise(epsilon)
    }
}
```

### Quantum-Inspired Temporal Analysis

```rust
struct QuantumInspiredTemporalState {
    // State vector representing temporal superposition
    state_vector: StateVector,
    
    fn analyze_temporal_patterns(&self) -> TemporalPattern {
        // Simulate quantum walk on temporal states [4]
        let walk = QuantumWalk::new(self.state_vector);
        
        walk.evolve(STEPS)

### State Transition Implementation

```rust
struct StateTransition {
    from_state: TimeState,
    to_state: TimeState,
    transition_rules: Vec<TransitionRule>,
    metadata: TransitionMetadata,

    fn validate_transition(&self) -> Result<bool> {
        self.transition_rules.iter()
            .all(|rule| rule.check(self.from_state, self.to_state))
    }

    fn execute(&self) -> Result<TimeState> {
        if !self.validate_transition()? {
            return Err(TransitionError::InvalidTransition);
        }
        self.apply_transition() // Updates weights based on backpropagation [5]
    }
}
```
