# Conceptual time states

Percept-triplets do not require a time vector to successfully encode a percept + concept into a prototype, but a time vector can be added to the percept-triplet to represent conceptual time states:

- **Mundane time state**: a past or future timestamp that relates to the percept, such as the time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept, or an imagined future date related to an imagined future event
- **Quantum time state**: a conceptual state of indeterminate or no time, or immeasurable present time
- **Holographic time state**: a conceptual time state paired with a percept that is attuned to a reference time, such as a natal chart

## Encoded percept-triplet vectors + time states

The percept-triplet model with the addition of conceptual time state vectors expands the encoding to include temporal dimensions.

With the addition of the conceptual time vector to a percept-triplet, the concept can be placed exactly in time and space on the chart. One example of a time vector is using the time-date stamp of the entry of the input to the Memorativa system (capturing a mundane time state).

Without the time state vector, the percept-triplet remains in an indefinite *quantum state*. The quantum time state enables the "tuning" of the placement of the imaginary planet by opportunistically calculating its placement based on potential angular relationships with other planets or nodes.

Holographic time states connect superimposed charts across time states (past to past, past to future, past to conceptual, conceptual to conceptual, etc.) by using a reference chart against one or more superimposed charts. The reference chart becomes useful when superimposed charts that have no time vector and hence no actual degree location can be "tuned" to find a related, instantiated location with a degree.

## Conceptual time state vectors

| **Time State**          | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mundane Time State**   | Represents a specific timestamp (past or future) related to the concept        | The time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept |
| **Quantum Time State**   | Represents an indeterminate or immeasurable present time                       | A concept that exists outside of linear time, such as a memory or dream     |
| **Holographic Time State** | Represents a conceptual time state attuned to a reference time (e.g., a natal chart) | Superimposing a natal chart with a transit chart to analyze daily events in reference to personal meaning |

The percept-triplet model with conceptual time state vectors encodes 6 primary vectors (3 percept-triplet + 3 time state) and hundreds of sub-vectors when considering the multiple correlations, modes, domains, and temporal dimensions within each primary vector. The exact number depends on the depth of analysis for each planet, sign, house, and time state.

In the context of the structure of the prototype, it is possible for each percept-triplet to have the same or different conceptual time states.

The Memorativa temporal state model allows for richer temporal and conceptual analysis, enabling the system to encode percepts with both spatial and temporal dimensions.

## Vector encoding

The percept-triplet model with conceptual time state vectors encodes 6 primary vectors (3 percept-triplet + 3 time state) and hundreds of sub-vectors when considering the multiple correlations, modes, domains, and temporal dimensions within each primary vector. The exact number depends on the depth of analysis for each planet, sign, house, and time state.

Each percept-triplet can have independent time states, allowing for flexible temporal relationships within the prototype structure.

## Privacy-preserving time states

Each time state now implements privacy preservation:

```rust
struct PrivateTemporalStates {
    mundane: Option<PrivateDateTime>,    // Privacy-preserving timestamp
    quantum: PrivateQuantumState,        // Protected conceptual time
    holographic: Option<PrivateChartRef> // Private reference alignment
}

impl PrivateTemporalStates {
    fn calculate_temporal_weight(&self) -> Result<f32> {
        // Add noise to temporal calculations
        match self {
            Some(mundane) => compute_private_mundane_weight(mundane),
            None => self.quantum.get_private_conceptual_weight()
        }
    }
}
```

## Quantum-inspired temporal analysis

Temporal states can be analyzed using quantum-inspired superposition:

```rust
struct QuantumInspiredTemporalState {
    // State vector representing temporal superposition
    state_vector: StateVector,
    
    fn analyze_temporal_patterns(&self) -> TemporalPattern {
        // Simulate quantum walk on temporal states
        let walk = QuantumWalk::new(self.state_vector);
        
        walk.evolve(STEPS)
            .measure_distribution()
            .extract_pattern()
    }
}
```

Benefits:
- Simultaneous analysis of multiple time states
- More efficient pattern detection
- Better handling of quantum/mundane/holographic state transitions

## State transition rules

### Quantum to Mundane Transitions
- Occurs when a quantum state concept gets anchored to a specific timestamp
- Requires either:
  - User explicitly setting a timestamp
  - System detecting temporal reference in content
  - Pattern matching with existing mundane events
- Preserves original quantum properties as metadata

### Mundane to Quantum Transitions  
- Occurs when temporal specificity needs to be relaxed
- Triggered by:
  - Pattern analysis requiring temporal flexibility
  - User removing timestamp
  - Merging multiple mundane states into a conceptual pattern
- Maintains link to original mundane timestamp as reference

```rust
struct StateTransition {
    from_state: TimeState,
    to_state: TimeState,
    transition_rules: Vec<TransitionRule>,
    metadata: TransitionMetadata,

    fn validate_transition(&self) -> Result<bool> {
        self.transition_rules.iter()
            .all(|rule| rule.check(self.from_state, self.to_state))
    }

    fn execute(&self) -> Result<TimeState> {
        if !self.validate_transition()? {
            return Err(TransitionError::InvalidTransition);
        }
        self.apply_transition()
    }
}
```

## Key points

- Time vectors expand percept-triplets to encode temporal dimensions through three states:
  - Mundane: Concrete timestamps for real events
  - Quantum: Indeterminate/timeless states for flexible conceptual mapping
  - Holographic: Reference-based states for chart correlations
- The model combines 3 percept vectors + 3 time state vectors, enabling rich spatiotemporal encoding
- Privacy preservation and quantum-inspired analysis provide enhanced temporal pattern detection
- Time states can operate independently within a prototype structure
