# 2.24. Tokenomics

The Memorativa token economy employs a dual token model:

1. Glass Bead Tokens (GBTk) - Knowledge artifacts representing verified human thought
2. Gas Bead Tokens (GBT) - Utility tokens powering system operations

## Glass Bead Token Economy

Glass Bead Tokens represent verified knowledge artifacts in the system:

### Token Types
- Natal Glass Beads (NGB) - Core identity and reference tokens
- Standard Glass Beads (GBTk) - Knowledge artifacts
- Gas Bead Tokens (GBT) - Utility tokens

### Natal Glass Bead Properties
- One-time minting cost: 1000 GBT
- Non-fungible identity token
- Rare transfer capability (500 GBT)
- Activity logging (1 GBT per action)
- Template updates (10-20 GBT)
- Crystal archival storage (50 GBT)
- Required for system participation

### Token Properties
- SPL token standard implementation
- Encapsulates percept-triplets, prototypes, and focus spaces
- Maintains privacy levels and access controls
- Tracks verification scores and temporal states
- Preserves attribution and ownership data
- Supports Merkle tree verification

### Value Generation
- Created through human conceptual work
- Validated through peer review and system verification
- Enhanced through pattern recognition and synthesis
- Evolved through knowledge development
- Enriched by collaborative refinement

### Token Utility
- Knowledge artifact ownership
- RAG system contribution
- Pattern template creation
- Focus space development
- Book generation
- Collaborative synthesis

## Gas Bead Token Economy

Gas Bead Tokens power all system operations:

### Core Operations
| Operation | Cost | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Natal Bead Creation | 1000 GBT | One-time identity token |
| Natal Bead Transfer | 500 GBT | Identity transfer ritual |
| Natal Template Update | 10-20 GBT | Reference modification |
| Crystal Archival | 50 GBT | 5D storage encoding |
| Percept Creation | 1-5 GBT | Adding new percepts |
| Prototype Formation | 5-15 GBT | Creating patterns |
| Focus Space Creation | 10-30 GBT | Opening workspaces |
| Book Generation | 20-50 GBT | Synthesizing knowledge |
| Template Updates | 10-20 GBT | Reference modification |

### Reward Structure
| Activity | Reward | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Quality Percepts | 5-10 GBT | Meaningful contributions |
| Prototype Validation | 2-5 GBT | Pattern verification |
| Book Creation | 20-50 GBT | Knowledge synthesis |
| System Validation | 1-3 GBT | Basic maintenance |
| Focus Space Sharing | 5-15 GBT | Public space creation |
| Knowledge Synthesis | 10-30 GBT | Pattern combination |

### Daily Allocation
- Basic activities earn 15-30 GBT
- Active contributors earn 50-100 GBT
- Monthly active users maintain positive flow
- Bonus rewards for first-time operations
- Community rewards for collaboration

```

### Value Creation Cycle
1. Users spend Gas Beads to create content
2. Quality contributions generate Glass Beads
3. Validation activities earn Gas Bead rewards
4. Knowledge synthesis creates additional value
5. Collaboration amplifies token utility

## Collaborative Economics

### Sharing Models
| Model | Gas Cost | Reward | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Read-Only | 1 GBT/link | 0.1 GBT/viewer | View-only access |
| Full Access | 5 GBT/user | 2 GBT/contribution | Edit permissions |
| Temporary | 3 GBT/hour | Split by metrics | Time-limited access |
| Fork-Merge | 10 GBT fork | 15 GBT merge | Async collaboration |

### Group Rewards
- Collective challenges: 20-50 GBT pool
- Shared discoveries: 15-30 GBT split
- Community validation: 5-15 GBT distributed

### Bonus Multipliers
- Consistent collaboration: 1.5x
- High-quality patterns: 2x
- Novel connections: 1.8x
- Community impact: 1.3x
