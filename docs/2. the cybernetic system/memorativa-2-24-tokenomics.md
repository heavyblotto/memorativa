# 2.24. Tokenomics

The Memorativa token economy forms the foundational economic layer that powers all system operations, incentivizes quality contributions, and ensures sustained value creation within the knowledge ecosystem. Tokenomics in Memorativa is not merely a financial mechanism but a cognitive incentive structure designed to align individual contributions with collective knowledge advancement.

This economic framework addresses several critical challenges in knowledge systems: attribution preservation, quality validation, collaborative incentives, computational resource allocation, and long-term sustainability. By tokenizing both knowledge artifacts and system operations, Memorativa creates a self-reinforcing economy where value flows to contributors while maintaining system integrity.

The Memorativa token economy employs a dual token model:

1. **Glass Bead Tokens (GBTk)** - Knowledge artifacts representing verified human thought, implemented as non-fungible SPL tokens with spatial-semantic encoding
2. **Gas Bead Tokens (GBT)** - Utility tokens powering system operations with adaptive pricing based on computational requirements

This dual token approach separates knowledge value (GBTk) from operational utility (GBT), creating distinct but complementary economic flows that support the system's cognitive architecture. The token economy dynamically responds to usage patterns, transit-influenced conditions, and quality metrics to maintain balance while rewarding meaningful contributions.

## Glass Bead Token Economy

## Key Math

- **Glass Bead Value Function**: The value of a Glass Bead token is calculated as:
  $V_{GBTk} = \beta \cdot (Q \cdot C \cdot R \cdot T)$
  
  Where:
  - $\beta$ is the base value coefficient (system parameter)
  - $Q$ is the quality score (verification rating from 0.1 to 2.0)
  - $C$ is the connection factor (1 + 0.05n where n = number of references)
  - $R$ is the reuse factor (1 + 0.1u where u = utilization count)
  - $T$ is the time factor ($1 + \log_{10}(d + 1)$ where d = days since creation)

### Adaptive Pricing

- **Gas Bead Operation Cost**: The actual cost of an operation is dynamically calculated as:
  $C_{op} = C_{base} \cdot L \cdot P \cdot T \cdot D$
  
  Where:
  - $C_{base}$ is the base cost from the operation tables
  - $L$ is the system load factor (0.8 to 1.5)
  - $P$ is the privacy premium (1.0 to 1.5 based on privacy requirements)
  - $T$ is the transit modifier (0.85 to 1.15 based on planetary transits)
  - $D$ is the depth modifier (1.0 + 0.05d where d = recursive depth)

### Transit Modifiers

- **Transit Discount Function**: The discount applied during favorable transits:
  $D_{transit} = 1 - (0.05 + 0.01 \cdot h \cdot a)$
  
  Where:
  - $h$ is the transit harmony score (0 to 10)
  - $a$ is the aspect strength (0 to 1)

- **Transit Premium Function**: The premium applied during challenging transits:
  $P_{transit} = 1 + (0.05 + 0.01 \cdot c \cdot a)$
  
  Where:
  - $c$ is the transit challenge score (0 to 10)
  - $a$ is the aspect strength (0 to 1)

### Reward Calculations

- **Base Reward Function**: The base reward for contributions:
  $R_{base} = \alpha \cdot Q \cdot E$
  
  Where:
  - $\alpha$ is the base reward coefficient (system parameter)
  - $Q$ is the quality score (0.1 to 2.0)
  - $E$ is the effort factor (estimated computational/cognitive effort)

- **Collaboration Multiplier**: The reward multiplier for collaborative work:
  $M_{collab} = 1 + (\frac{n-1}{10} \cdot \frac{S_d}{S_{max}})$
  
  Where:
  - $n$ is the number of collaborators
  - $S_d$ is the skill diversity score
  - $S_{max}$ is the maximum possible skill diversity

### Economic Equilibrium

- **Token Velocity Equation**: The circulation velocity of Gas Bead Tokens:
  $V_{GBT} = \frac{T \cdot P}{M}$
  
  Where:
  - $T$ is the transaction volume
  - $P$ is the average operation price
  - $M$ is the monetary supply of GBT

- **Sustainable Supply Growth**: The target supply growth rate is calculated as:
  $g_{target} = \max(0, \min(0.04, \frac{U_g - U_c}{U_c} \cdot k))$
  
  Where:
  - $U_g$ is the user growth rate
  - $U_c$ is the current user base
  - $k$ is an adjustment coefficient (typically 0.5)
  - 0.04 represents the 4% annual inflation cap

### Merkle Verification Mathematics

- **Angular Consistency Validation**: For verifying integrity of angular relationships:
  $|\theta_{claimed} - \theta_{calculated}| < \tau$
  
  Where:
  - $\theta_{claimed}$ is the claimed angle between concepts
  - $\theta_{calculated}$ is the computed angle
  - $\tau$ is the tolerance threshold

- **Curvature Consistency**: For concepts across different reference frames:
  $|\kappa_{F1}(p) - \kappa_{F2}(p)| < \delta$
  
  Where:
  - $\kappa_{F1}(p)$ is the curvature of percept p in frame F1
  - $\kappa_{F2}(p)$ is the curvature of the same percept in frame F2
  - $\delta$ is the allowable difference threshold

### Spherical-Hyperbolic Coordinate System

- **Percept Vector Encoding**: Each percept is encoded using spherical-hyperbolic coordinates:
  $(θ, φ, r, κ)$
  
  Where:
  - $θ$ is the azimuthal angle (0 to 2π)
  - $φ$ is the polar angle (0 to π)
  - $r$ is the radial distance
  - $κ$ is the curvature parameter

- **Angular Relation Between Percepts**: The effective angle between percepts p₁ and p₂:
  $\Theta_{eff}(p_1, p_2) = \cos^{-1}(\sin φ_1 \sin φ_2 \cos(θ_1 - θ_2) + \cos φ_1 \cos φ_2) \cdot f(κ_1, κ_2)$
  
  Where:
  - $f(κ_1, κ_2)$ is a curvature adjustment function

        depthModifier = 1.0 + (0.05 * operationType.recursiveDepth)
    
    // Step 6: Apply all modifiers to calculate final cost
    finalCost = baseCost * loadFactor * privacyPremium * transitModifier * depthModifier
    
    // Step 7: Apply any special discounts (e.g., first-time operations)
    if IsEligibleForDiscount(userData, operationType):
        finalCost = ApplyDiscount(finalCost, GetDiscountRate(userData, operationType))

### Key Design Considerations

- The implementation uses a modular approach to separate different pricing factors
- Dynamic pricing factors reflect both system conditions and user-specific contexts
- Transit calculations incorporate astrological principles while maintaining computational efficiency
- The system maintains a 0.85-1.15 range for transit modifiers to ensure predictable costs
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of relevant transits
- Space complexity: O(1) for the calculation itself (excluding input data structures)

### Glass Bead Token Value System

The following code examples demonstrate the implementation of the Glass Bead Token (GBTk) value calculation system, which determines the economic value of knowledge artifacts in the Memorativa ecosystem.

#### Conceptual Pseudocode

// Calculates the value of a Glass Bead Token based on its properties
function CalculateGlassBeadValue(glassBeadId, tokenMetadata, systemParameters):
    // Step 1: Retrieve the base token data
    tokenData = GetGlassBeadData(glassBeadId)
    
    // Step 2: Calculate quality score based on verification ratings
    qualityScore = CalculateQualityScore(tokenData.verificationRatings)
    
    // Step 3: Calculate connection factor based on references
    connectionCount = CountReferences(tokenData.references)
    connectionFactor = 1.0 + (0.05 * connectionCount)
    
    // Step 4: Calculate reuse factor based on utilization
    utilizationCount = CountUtilizations(glassBeadId)
    reuseFactor = 1.0 + (0.1 * utilizationCount)
    
    // Step 5: Calculate time factor based on age
    daysSinceCreation = CalculateDaysSince(tokenData.creationTimestamp)
    timeFactor = 1.0 + log10(daysSinceCreation + 1)
    
    // Step 6: Multiply all factors by the base coefficient
    baseCoefficient = systemParameters.glassBeadBaseValue
    tokenValue = baseCoefficient * qualityScore * connectionFactor * reuseFactor * timeFactor
    
    // Step 7: Apply any special modifiers based on token category
    if HasSpecialCategory(tokenData.category):
        categoryMultiplier = GetCategoryMultiplier(tokenData.category)
        tokenValue *= categoryMultiplier
    
    return tokenValue
```

### Key Design Considerations

- The implementation uses multiple weighted factors to determine token value
- Time-based decay ensures that verification remains current and valuable
- Connection and reuse factors incentivize both references and practical application
- Category multipliers allow the system to prioritize certain knowledge domains
- Collaborative work is rewarded through the attribution factor
- Verified Glass Beads are worth significantly more than unverified ones
- Time complexity: O(v + r + u) where v = verification count, r = reference count, u = utilization count
- All calculations maintain deterministic outcomes for consistent valuation

### Collaboration Reward Distribution System

The following code examples demonstrate the implementation of the Collaboration Reward Distribution system, which calculates and distributes rewards among multiple contributors based on their expertise diversity and contribution quality.

#### Conceptual Pseudocode

```
// Calculates and distributes rewards for collaborative work
function DistributeCollaborationRewards(contributorIds, contributions, skillProfiles, baseReward):
    // Step 1: Calculate the skill diversity score
    skillDiversity = CalculateSkillDiversity(contributorIds, skillProfiles)
    
    // Step 2: Calculate the collaboration multiplier
    collaboratorCount = contributorIds.length
    maxPossibleDiversity = CalculateMaxPossibleDiversity(contributorIds.length)
    collaborationMultiplier = 1.0 + ((collaboratorCount - 1) / 10.0) * (skillDiversity / maxPossibleDiversity)
    
    // Step 3: Apply the multiplier to the base reward
    totalReward = baseReward * collaborationMultiplier
    
    // Step 4: Calculate individual contribution weights
    contributionWeights = []
    totalContributionValue = 0
    
    for each contribution in contributions:
        // Calculate weight based on contribution quality, effort, and temporal factors
        weight = CalculateContributionWeight(contribution)
        contributionWeights.append(weight)
        totalContributionValue += weight
    
    // Step 5: Distribute rewards based on contribution weights
    individualRewards = []
    
    for each weight in contributionWeights:
        reward = (weight / totalContributionValue) * totalReward
        individualRewards.append(reward)
    
    // Step 6: Apply any special bonuses for key contributions
    for i = 0 to contributorIds.length - 1:
        if HasSpecialContribution(contributions[i]):
            bonusAmount = CalculateSpecialBonus(contributions[i], totalReward)
            individualRewards[i] += bonusAmount
    
    // Step 7: Return the distributed rewards with contributor details
    return {
        collaborationMultiplier: collaborationMultiplier,
        totalReward: totalReward,
        individualRewards: zip(contributorIds, individualRewards)
    }
```

### Key Design Considerations

- The implementation rewards skill diversity while ensuring fair distribution based on actual contributions
- Each contributor's input is weighted by quality, effort, and importance
- Special bonuses recognize exceptional contributions that meet quality thresholds
- Reputation scores influence reward distribution but are not dominant factors
- The system can scale to accommodate any number of contributors
- Time complexity: O(c * s + e) where c = contributor count, s = skill count, e = element count
- Space complexity: O(c * s) for storing skill profiles and distribution calculations
- The model dynamically adapts to different collaboration sizes and skill compositions

### Token Minting System

The following code examples demonstrate the implementation of the token minting process in Memorativa, covering both Glass Bead Token (GBTk) and Gas Bead Token (GBT) creation mechanisms.

#### Conceptual Pseudocode

```
// Glass Bead Token Minting Process
function MintGlassBeadToken(creator, contentHash, metadata, verifications):
    // Step 1: Validate content and metadata
    if !ValidateContent(contentHash, metadata):
        return Error("Invalid content or metadata")
    
    // Step 2: Check minimum verification threshold
    if verifications.length < MINIMUM_VERIFICATIONS:
        return Error("Insufficient verifications")
    
    // Step 3: Calculate initial token value
    initialValue = CalculateInitialTokenValue(metadata, verifications)
    
    // Step 4: Generate unique token identifier
    tokenId = GenerateTokenId(contentHash, creator, timestamp)
    
    // Step 5: Create token on-chain
    token = {
        id: tokenId,
        creator: creator,
        contentHash: contentHash,
        metadata: metadata,
        verifications: verifications,
        value: initialValue,
        creationTime: timestamp,
        category: metadata.category
    }
    
    // Step 6: Emit token creation event and update indices
    EmitTokenCreated(token)
    UpdateContentIndex(contentHash, tokenId)
    UpdateCreatorIndex(creator, tokenId)
    
    // Step 7: Assign token to creator and apply any reward distributions
    AssignTokenToCreator(creator, tokenId)
    DistributeVerificationRewards(verifications)
    
    return token

// Gas Bead Token Minting Process
function MintGasBeadTokens(amount, mintingAuthority, targetAddress, mintingReason):
    // Step 1: Validate minting authority has permission
    if !ValidateMintingAuthority(mintingAuthority):
        return Error("Unauthorized minting attempt")
    
    // Step 2: Check economic parameters and limits
    economicState = GetCurrentEconomicState()
    if !ValidateMintingLimits(amount, economicState):
        return Error("Minting amount exceeds current economic limits")
    
    // Step 3: Calculate any adjustment factors based on economic state
    adjustmentFactor = CalculateAdjustmentFactor(economicState)
    adjustedAmount = amount * adjustmentFactor
    
    // Step 4: Record minting event with reason
    mintEvent = {
        authority: mintingAuthority,
        recipient: targetAddress,
        amount: adjustedAmount,
        reason: mintingReason,
        timestamp: timestamp,
        economicState: economicState,
        adjustmentFactor: adjustmentFactor
    }
    
    // Step 5: Execute token minting transaction
    ExecuteMintTransaction(targetAddress, adjustedAmount)
    EmitMintingEvent(mintEvent)
    
    // Step 6: Update economic indicators
    UpdateCirculatingSupply(adjustedAmount)
    UpdateTokenVelocityMetrics()
    
    return {
        mintingEvent: mintEvent,
        newBalance: GetBalance(targetAddress),
        tokenId: GenerateBatchId(timestamp, mintingAuthority)
    }
```
