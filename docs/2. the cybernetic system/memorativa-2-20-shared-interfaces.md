# 2.20. Shared interfaces

The interface layer of Memorativa provides collaborative mechanisms through which players interact with shared structures and each other. These interfaces enable the creation, validation, and evolution of knowledge within the system while maintaining privacy and attribution.

## Core Interface Types

1. **Input Interfaces**
   - Content capture tools
   - URL/media processors
   - Text input systems
   - Batch import tools
   - Privacy selectors
   - Attribution markers

2. **Processing Interfaces**
   - Percept creation workbench
   - Prototype builders
   - Focus space designers
   - Book editors
   - MST translators
   - RAG query tools

3. **Analysis Interfaces**
   - Pattern recognition tools
   - Relationship mappers
   - Temporal analyzers
   - Lens selectors
   - Validation panels
   - Aspect calculators

4. **Collaboration Interfaces**
   - Shared workspaces
   - Group analysis tools
   - Pattern voting systems
   - Version controllers
   - Permission managers
   - Attribution trackers
