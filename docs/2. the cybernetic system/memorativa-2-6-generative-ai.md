# 2.6. Generative AI

## Introduction

Generative AI is the engine that powers Memorativa's ability to transform player inputs into percepts, prototypes, and Books. It leverages large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create dynamic narratives, visualizations, and analyses based on the player's inner cosmos.

The generative AI architecture bridges human meaning-making and machine understanding, creating a sustainable ecosystem for personal knowledge development and AI training.

## Main Content

### Key features

- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Processes text and images to create percepts and prototypes.
  - Leverages CLIP-based models to identify visual archetypes from uploaded images [3]
  - Transforms visual concepts into the same hybrid triplet space as text inputs
  - Cross-modal alignment ensures consistent processing across input types
  - See [Section 3.3: Spatial Indices](../3.%20the%20machine%20system/memorativa-3-3-spatial-indices.md) for technical implementation details
  - Employs keyword hints system to guide AI interpretation of ambiguous patterns
  - Semantic bridging via shared vocabulary tags across modalities
  - Bidirectional feedback loop between text and visual encoding streams
  - Context-aware prioritization of relevant domain keywords across modes
- **Symbolic Pattern Recognition**: Identifies archetypal patterns in player inputs, using Western mythology and cultural references as a framework.
  - Recognizes technical archetypes through the Memorativa Symbolic Translator (MST)
  - Supports domain-specific pattern recognition including scientific, mathematical, and technical fields
  - Adaptive recognition capabilities expand through the [Section 2.13: Lens System](./memorativa-2-13-lens-system.md) for flexibility across domains
- **Contextual Bridging**: Maintains semantic relationships between percepts and prototypes, ensuring conceptual coherence.
- **Feedback-Driven Refinement**: Uses player validation to refine the generative AI's understanding of percepts and prototypes.

### Integration with Glass Beads

- Each glass bead references the percepts, prototypes, and Books generated by the generative AI.
- The **Spherical Merkle Tree** in each bead ensures data integrity and evolution tracking of the generative AI's outputs while preserving angular relationships between percepts in hybrid spherical-hyperbolic space.
- The **SPL token standard** enables verifiable ownership and transfer of the generative AI's outputs, supporting collaborative knowledge development.
- **Privacy Levels**: Glass beads respect the privacy settings of Book entries, percepts, and prototypes, which can be:
  - **Private**: Only accessible to the player.
  - **Not Shared**: Accessible to the player and the system for AI training but not shared with others.
  - **Public**: Accessible to all players and the system.
  - **Shared**: Accessible to specific players or groups, as defined by the player.

### Spherical Merkle Tree Integration

The generative AI system ensures that percept-triplets created during the generation process are properly integrated with Spherical Merkle Trees to preserve both hierarchical and angular relationships.

### Flexible Correspondence Tables

The system employs consensus-driven flexible correspondence tables to handle conflicting interpretations from different symbolic traditions.

### Operational Costs

Each generative AI operation consumes GBT (Gas Bead Tokens) according to a relative cost structure designed to balance system resource requirements with player engagement:

| Operation | Relative Cost | GBT Cost | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Multi-Modal Analysis | Highest | 12-18 GBT | Processing images alongside text requires significant computational resources for cross-modal alignment |
| Book Generation | High | 20-50 GBT | Creating comprehensive narratives from multiple percepts and prototypes with spatial coherence |
| Prototype Aggregation | Medium-High | 8-15 GBT | Analyzing and organizing collections of percepts in 3D space with relational preservation |
| Focus Space Creation | Medium-High | 10-15 GBT | Establishing new conceptual workspaces |
| Percept Creation | Medium | 5-10 GBT | Converting raw inputs to vector representations with title-description generation |
| Vector Modification | Medium | 3-7 GBT | Changing core vectors in the triplet structure |
| Symbolic Translation | Medium | 4-8 GBT | Mapping between perception space and symbolic representations |
| Prototype Integration | Medium-Low | 1-3 GBT | Connecting percepts to form coherent structures |
| Contextual Bridging | Medium-Low | 2-4 GBT | Maintaining semantic relationships between entities |
| Spatial Query | Low | 2-5 GBT | Searching through the vector space |
| Spherical Index Query | Lowest | 1-2 GBT | Simple retrieval of spatially-related elements without generative components |

The Gas Bead Token economics follow these principles:
- **Computational Complexity**: Operations requiring more intensive processing (especially cross-modal) cost proportionally more
- **Storage Impact**: Operations that generate persistent data structures have costs reflecting long-term storage
- **Network Effects**: Shared percepts and prototypes receive cost discounts to encourage knowledge contributions
- **Privacy Premium**: Private operations cost more than shareable ones, reflecting the lost network effects
- **Batch Optimization**: Volume discounts for batch operations to encourage efficient resource utilization
- **Quality Incentives**: Higher-quality inputs (well-structured, clear concepts) receive processing discounts
- **Domain Specificity**: Technical and specialized domain processing receives targeted pricing based on computational requirements

Users are rewarded with GBT for contributing to the system:
- Creating quality percepts (5-10 GBT)
- Refining vectors (3-7 GBT)
- Generating books (20-50 GBT)
- Validating content (0.5-1 GBT)
- Sharing knowledge (5-15 GBT)
- Validating prototypes (3-8 GBT)

This creates a self-sustaining economic system that balances computational costs with knowledge creation incentives. For a detailed breakdown of specific costs and reward structures, see [Section 2.18: Gas Bead Tokens](../2.%20the%20cybernetic%20system/memorativa-2-18-gas-bead-tokens.md).

## Key Math

- **Spherical Vector Representation**: For mapping concepts in three-dimensional space:
  ```
  P(θ, φ, r) = (r·sin(φ)·cos(θ), r·sin(φ)·sin(θ), r·cos(φ))
  ```
  where θ is the azimuthal angle, φ is the polar angle, and r is the radius.

- **Angular Relationship Measurement**: For calculating semantic similarity between percepts:
  ```
  sim(p₁, p₂) = cos⁻¹(p₁·p₂ / (|p₁|·|p₂|))
  ```
  where p₁ and p₂ are vector representations of percepts.

- **Hybrid Space Curvature**: For determining the appropriate spatial representation:
  ```
  k(c) = α·log(hierarchical_weight(c)) - β·log(angular_weight(c))
  ```
  where k is the curvature parameter, c is the context, and α and β are weighting factors.

## Code Examples

    # Organize triplets using both spherical and hyperbolic distances
    organized = organize_by_hybrid_distance(triplets, centroid)
    
    # Create prototype preserving both geometric relationships
    return create_hybrid_prototype(
        organized,

    gas_token.verify_balance(cost)
    
    # Extract 3D spatial patterns
    patterns = analyze_spatial_patterns(prototype)
    
    # Burn gas incrementally for each section
    for section in patterns.to_sections():

        return merkle_node
```
