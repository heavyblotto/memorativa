# 2.6. Generative AI

## Summary



## Introduction

The MST leverages generative AI ([Section 2.6](./memorativa-2-6-generative-ai.md)) to create dynamic English language narratives and analyses based on percept-triplets and prototypes.

Generative AI is the engine that powers Memorativa's ability to transform player inputs into percepts, prototypes, and Books. It leverages large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create dynamic narratives, visualizations, and analyses based on the player's inner cosmos.

The generative AI architecture bridges human meaning-making and machine understanding, creating a sustainable ecosystem for personal knowledge development and AI training.


## Key features

- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Processes text and images to create percepts and prototypes.
  - Leverages CLIP-based models to identify visual archetypes from uploaded images [3]
  - Transforms visual concepts into the same hybrid triplet space as text inputs
  - Cross-modal alignment ensures consistent processing across input types
  - See [Section 3.3: Spatial Indices](../3.%20the%20machine%20system/memorativa-3-3-spatial-indices.md) for technical implementation details
  - Employs keyword hints system to guide AI interpretation of ambiguous patterns
  - Semantic bridging via shared vocabulary tags across modalities
  - Bidirectional feedback loop between text and visual encoding streams
  - Context-aware prioritization of relevant domain keywords across modes
- **Symbolic Pattern Recognition**: Identifies archetypal patterns in player inputs, using Western mythology and cultural references as a framework.
  - Recognizes technical archetypes through the Memorativa Symbolic Translator (MST)
  - Supports domain-specific pattern recognition including scientific, mathematical, and technical fields
  - Adaptive recognition capabilities expand through the [Section 2.13: Lens System](./memorativa-2-13-lens-system.md) for flexibility across domains
  - Future integration with the Lens System will enable lens-based transformations, allowing diverse symbolic interpretations and spatial transformations while preserving verification integrity
- **Contextual Bridging**: Maintains semantic relationships between percepts and prototypes, ensuring conceptual coherence.
- **Feedback-Driven Refinement**: Uses player validation to refine the generative AI's understanding of percepts and prototypes.
- **Percept-Triplet Structure**: Clearly defined by three conceptual vectors:
  - **Archetypal (What)**: Represented by planetary archetypes.
  - **Expressive (How)**: Represented by zodiacal signs.
  - **Contextual (Where)**: Represented by astrological houses.
  - Each percept-triplet includes a concise title and description for intuitive understanding.
- **Hybrid Spherical-Hyperbolic Geometry**:
  - Utilizes a dynamic curvature parameter (Îº) to balance hierarchical (hyperbolic) and symbolic/angular (spherical) relationships.
  - Ensures efficient spatial queries and semantic coherence.
- **Merkle Preservation**:
  - Percept-triplet coordinates and angular relationships are securely stored and verified using Spherical Merkle Trees.
  - Integrates seamlessly into the Glass Bead storage framework.

## Integration with Glass Beads

- Glass Beads ([Section 2.3](./memorativa-2-3-glass-beads.md)) encapsulate and verify percepts, prototypes, and Books generated by the generative AI, ensuring data integrity through Spherical Merkle Trees.
- Each glass bead references the percepts, prototypes, and Books generated by the generative AI.
- The **Spherical Merkle Tree** in each bead ensures data integrity and evolution tracking of the generative AI's outputs while preserving angular relationships between percepts in hybrid spherical-hyperbolic space.
- Verification is hybrid, combining hierarchical integrity checks with angular relationship validation, ensuring both content and spatial consistency.
- The **SPL token standard** enables verifiable ownership and transfer of the generative AI's outputs, supporting collaborative knowledge development.
- **Privacy Levels**: Glass beads respect the privacy settings of Book entries, percepts, and prototypes, which can be:
  - **Private**: Only accessible to the player.
  - **Not Shared**: Accessible to the player and the system for AI training but not shared with others.
  - **Public**: Accessible to all players and the system.
  - **Shared**: Accessible to specific players or groups, as defined by the player.

## Spherical Merkle Tree Integration

The generative AI system ensures that percept-triplets created during the generation process are properly integrated with Spherical Merkle Trees to preserve both hierarchical and angular relationships.

- **Hybrid Verification System**: The system implements a dual-layered verification approach that:
  - Validates hierarchical structure and data integrity (standard Merkle verification)
  - Confirms angular relationships between percepts (spatial verification)
  - Ensures topological consistency in curved conceptual space
  - Provides O(log n) verification complexity for efficient verification

- **Integrity Preservation**: When generating percepts and prototypes, the system:
  - Creates cryptographic hashes incorporating both content and spatial relationships
  - Validates all new angular relationships against existing spatial structures
  - Enforces data integrity across both hierarchical and angular dimensions
  - Maintains verifiable lineage for all generative outputs

For detailed implementation of the Spherical Merkle Tree and hybrid verification system, see [Section 2.3: Glass Beads](./memorativa-2-3-glass-beads.md).

## Flexible Correspondence Tables

The system employs consensus-driven flexible correspondence tables to handle conflicting interpretations from different symbolic traditions.

## Operational Costs

Each generative AI operation consumes GBT (Gas Bead Tokens) according to a relative cost structure designed to balance system resource requirements with player engagement:

| Operation | Relative Cost | GBT Cost | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Multi-Modal Analysis | Highest | 12-18 GBT | Processing images alongside text requires significant computational resources for cross-modal alignment |
| Book Generation | High | 20-50 GBT | Creating comprehensive narratives from multiple percepts and prototypes with spatial coherence |
| Prototype Aggregation | Medium-High | 8-15 GBT | Analyzing and organizing collections of percepts in 3D space with relational preservation |
| Focus Space Creation | Medium-High | 10-15 GBT | Establishing new conceptual workspaces |
| Percept Creation | Medium | 5-10 GBT | Establishing new conceptual structures requires significant validation |
| Vector Modification | Medium | 3-7 GBT | Changing core vectors impacts semantic relationships across the system |
| Symbolic Translation | Medium | 4-8 GBT | Mapping between perception space and symbolic representations |
| Prototype Integration | Medium-Low | 1-3 GBT | Connecting percepts to form coherent structures |
| Contextual Bridging | Medium-Low | 2-4 GBT | Maintaining semantic relationships between entities |
| Spatial Query | Low | 2-5 GBT | Searching through the vector space |
| Spherical Index Query | Lowest | 1-2 GBT | Simple retrieval of spatially-related elements without generative components |

These costs align precisely with the operation costs outlined in [Section 2.3: Glass Beads](./memorativa-2-3-glass-beads.md), ensuring consistent token economics across the system.

The Gas Bead Token economics follow these principles:
- **Computational Complexity**: Operations requiring more intensive processing (especially cross-modal) cost proportionally more
- **Storage Impact**: Operations that generate persistent data structures have costs reflecting long-term storage
- **Network Effects**: Shared percepts and prototypes receive cost discounts to encourage knowledge contributions
- **Privacy Premium**: Private operations cost more than shareable ones, reflecting the lost network effects
- **Batch Optimization**: Volume discounts for batch operations to encourage efficient resource utilization
- **Quality Incentives**: Higher-quality inputs (well-structured, clear concepts) receive processing discounts
- **Domain Specificity**: Technical and specialized domain processing receives targeted pricing based on computational requirements

Users are rewarded with GBT for contributing to the system:
- Creating quality percepts (5-10 GBT)
- Refining vectors (3-7 GBT)
- Generating books (20-50 GBT)
- Validating content (0.5-1 GBT)
- Sharing knowledge (5-15 GBT)
- Validating prototypes (3-8 GBT)

This creates a self-sustaining economic system that balances computational costs with knowledge creation incentives. For a detailed breakdown of specific costs and reward structures, see [Section 2.18: Gas Bead Tokens](../2.%20the%20cybernetic%20system/memorativa-2-18-gas-bead-tokens.md).

## Key Math

- **Spherical Vector Representation**: For mapping concepts in three-dimensional space:
  ```
  P(Î¸, Ï, r) = (rÂ·sin(Ï)Â·cos(Î¸), rÂ·sin(Ï)Â·sin(Î¸), rÂ·cos(Ï))
  ```
  where Î¸ is the azimuthal angle, Ï is the polar angle, and r is the radius.

- **Angular Relationship Measurement**: For calculating semantic similarity between percepts:
  ```
  sim(pâ, pâ) = cosâ»Â¹(pâÂ·pâ / (|pâ|Â·|pâ|))
  ```
  where pâ and pâ are vector representations of percepts.

- **Hybrid Space Curvature**: For determining the appropriate spatial representation:
  ```
  k(c) = Î±Â·log(hierarchical_weight(c)) - Î²Â·log(angular_weight(c))
  ```
  where k is the curvature parameter, c is the context, and Î± and Î² are weighting factors.
