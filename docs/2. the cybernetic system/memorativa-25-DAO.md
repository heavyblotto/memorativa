# The Waldzell DAO

The Waldzell DAO governs Memorativa through a cybernetic system inspired by Hermann Hesse's *The Glass Bead Game*, where the pursuit of knowledge synthesis meets decentralized governance.

## Core Principles

1. **Knowledge Synthesis** - Like the Glass Bead Game players who connect ideas across disciplines, DAO members evaluate and integrate knowledge patterns
2. **Cybernetic Feedback** - Human feedback shapes the system's evolution through:
   - Quality assessment of generated content
   - Direction of research priorities
   - Governance proposals
3. **Meritocratic Governance** - Influence is earned through contributions, not token holdings
4. **Identity-Bound Participation** - Natal Glass Beads provide secure, privacy-preserving identity and reputation tracking

## Structure

### Magister Ludi (Steering Committee)
- Elected experts who guide overall direction
- Rotating positions to prevent entrenchment
- Must demonstrate both technical and humanistic expertise

### Knowledge Workers
- Researchers, developers, content creators
- Earn reputation through peer review
- Can propose and vote on system improvements

### Community Members
- Provide feedback and testing
- Participate in governance votes
- Earn tokens through valuable contributions

## Token Economics

### Dual Token System

1. **Glass Bead Token (GLASS)**
   - Knowledge artifact NFTs representing verified human thought
   - Created through quality contributions
   - Required for governance participation
   - Staked for proposal submission
   - Non-transferable during staking periods
   - Value derived from knowledge quality

2. **Natal Glass Bead (NGB)**
   - Core identity token for DAO participation
   - Records contribution history and reputation
   - Enables privacy-preserving voting
   - Required for role qualification
   - Nearly non-transferable (only for account recovery)

3. **Gas Bead Token (GBT)**
   - Powers all system operations
   - Required for proposal creation
   - Earned through:
     - Quality percept creation (5-10 GBT)
     - Prototype validation (2-5 GBT)
     - Book creation (20-50 GBT)
     - System validation (1-3 GBT)

### Reputation System
- Non-transferable score (0-100) bound to Natal Glass Bead
- Zero-knowledge proofs for anonymous reputation verification
- Weighted by expertise domains
- Affects voting power on technical decisions
- Required minimums for certain roles:
  - Magister Ludi: 90+ with 2+ years of recorded NGB history
  - Knowledge Worker: 70+ with 1+ year of NGB history
  - Community Member: 0+ with active NGB

### Economic Flows

1. **Contribution Rewards**
   - Daily activities: 15-30 GBT
   - Active contributors: 50-100 GBT
   - Quality multipliers: 1.5x-2x
   - Collaboration bonuses: 1.3x-1.8x

2. **Governance Costs**
   - Proposal submission: 50 GBT + GLASS stake
   - Technical proposal: 100 GBT + Expert validation
   - Emergency action: 200 GBT + Magister approval

3. **Value Accrual**
   - GLASS value from knowledge quality
   - GBT burning through governance
   - Reputation-weighted distributions
   - Impact-based rewards

## Governance Mechanisms

### Proposal System

1. **Creation Process**
   ```python
   class Proposal:
       def __init__(self, proposer: Address, category: ProposalType):
           self.required_gbt = category.base_cost
           self.required_glass = category.stake_requirement
           self.required_reputation = category.min_reputation
           self.timelock = category.timelock_period
           self.voting_period = category.voting_duration
           
       def validate(self) -> Result<()>:
           # Verify proposer meets requirements
           if not self.verify_proposer_requirements():
               return Err("Proposer does not meet requirements")
           
           # Lock required tokens
           self.lock_tokens()?
           
           # Initialize voting state
           self.initialize_voting()
           
           Ok(())
   ```

2. **Voting Mechanics**
   ```python
   class Vote:
       def cast_vote(self, voter: Address, support: bool) -> Result<()>:
           # Calculate voting power
           power = self.calculate_voting_power(voter)
           
           # Apply time-weighted bonus
           power *= self.time_weight_multiplier()
           
           # Record vote
           self.record_vote(voter, power, support)
           
           # Check thresholds
           self.check_execution_threshold()
   ```

3. **Execution Logic**
   ```python
   class ProposalExecution:
       def execute(self) -> Result<()>:
           # Verify timelock expired
           if !self.timelock_expired():
               return Err("Timelock active")
           
           # Verify quorum and approval
           if !self.verify_thresholds():
               return Err("Thresholds not met")
           
           # Execute proposal actions
           self.execute_actions()?
           
           # Distribute rewards/slashing
           self.handle_rewards()
           
           Ok(())
   ```

### Specialized Governance Tracks

1. **Technical Governance**
   - Architecture changes require expert validation
   - Multi-stage review process:
     1. Initial expert review (85+ reputation)
     2. Community feedback period
     3. Final expert vote
   - Higher GBT costs and longer timelocks
   - Requires proof-of-expertise validation

2. **Economic Governance**
   - Token parameter adjustments
   - Reward rate modifications
   - Cost structure updates
   - Requires economic simulation results
   - Impact analysis requirements

3. **Community Governance**
   - Partnership decisions
   - Research direction
   - Resource allocation
   - Lower thresholds but longer voting periods
   - Community feedback requirements

### Delegation System

```python
class Delegation:
    def delegate_power(
        self,
        delegator: Address,
        delegate: Address,
        power_type: PowerType
    ) -> Result<()>:
        match power_type:
            case PowerType.VotingPower:
                self.delegate_votes(delegator, delegate)
            case PowerType.ExpertiseValidation:
                self.delegate_validation(delegator, delegate)
            case PowerType.ProposalCreation:
                self.delegate_proposal_rights(delegator, delegate)
```

1. **Delegation Types**
   - Vote delegation
   - Expertise validation
   - Proposal creation rights
   - Partial power delegation
   - Time-limited delegation

2. **Delegation Rules**
   - Maximum delegation depth of 2
   - No circular delegation
   - Minimum self-retention of 10%
   - Expertise requirements for delegates
   - Real-time delegation updates

### Reputation-Weighted Voting

1. **Reputation Calculation**
```python
class ReputationScore:
    def calculate_score(self, member: Address) -> f32:
        base_score = self.contribution_quality * self.participation_rate
        expertise_bonus = self.calculate_expertise_bonus()
        time_factor = self.calculate_time_decay()
        
        return base_score * expertise_bonus * time_factor
```

2. **Expertise Domains**
   - Technical expertise
   - Economic understanding
   - Community leadership
   - Research contributions
   - Pattern recognition skill

3. **Time Decay**
   - Linear decay for inactivity
   - Bonus for consistent participation
   - Expertise preservation mechanics
   - Recovery through re-engagement

### Emergency Systems

1. **Emergency Actions**
   ```python
   class EmergencyAction:
       def trigger_emergency(self, condition: EmergencyCondition) -> Result<()>:
           if !self.verify_magister_approval(90):
               return Err("Insufficient approval")
           
           self.pause_affected_systems()
           self.notify_stakeholders()
           self.initiate_response()
   ```

2. **Circuit Breakers**
   - Automatic system pauses
   - Gradual recovery mechanisms
   - Magister override capabilities
   - Stakeholder notification system

3. **Recovery Procedures**
   - System state verification
   - Gradual feature re-enabling
   - Impact assessment requirements
   - Community communication protocols

### Governance Analytics

1. **Participation Metrics**

   - Technical stability metrics
   - Economic efficiency indicators
   - Pattern quality scores

3. **System Health Indicators**
   - Token velocity metrics
   - Reputation distribution
   - Expert availability
   - Governance participation
   - Pattern validation rates

### Identity and Privacy

```python
class GovernanceIdentity:
    def verify_participation_rights(self, natal_bead: NatalBead) -> Result<()>:
        # Verify NGB authenticity and activity history
        if !natal_bead.verify_authenticity():
            return Err("Invalid Natal Glass Bead")
            
        # Generate zero-knowledge proof of reputation
        let reputation_proof = natal_bead.generate_reputation_proof()
        
        # Verify role requirements
        self.verify_role_requirements(reputation_proof)
```

This governance system ensures:
- Technical excellence through expert validation
- Economic stability through careful parameter management
- Community engagement through accessible participation
- System security through multi-layered protection
- Continuous improvement through analytics-driven iteration

The integration with the dual-token model creates a balanced system where:
