# 2.1. The Cybernetic System

The Memorativa model describes a cybernetic system where a machine-human interface is defined. The interface completes the system by providing the player (human) of the game (machine) as an animating force and validator of the system. The player's input animates the system, while their validation ensures the structural correspondences defined by the model.

In this way, two worlds are bridged through Memorativa, connecting the **ideal** with the **real** through the human:

- **Human Interior World**: The world of perceptions and concepts, or the **"inner cosmos"**.
- **Machine Conceptual Space**: The space of vector relationships, where percepts and prototypes are analyzed and interpreted.

## Key points

- The system creates a **bidirectional interface** between human cognition and machine computation
- Human players serve dual roles as **animators** and **validators** of the system
- The machine space enables **formal analysis** of relationships between concepts
- The interface translates between **subjective experience** and **mathematical representation**
- This creates a continuous feedback loop of **perception**, **analysis**, and **validation**
