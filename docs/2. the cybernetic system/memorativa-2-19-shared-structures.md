# 2.19. Shared structures

Memorativa's shared structures represent the fundamental constructs that can be shared, verified, and evolved within the system through Glass Bead tokens. Each structure is encapsulated as a Glass Bead token with specific privacy controls, temporal states, and validation requirements.

## Structure hierarchy

1. **Basic Structures**
   - Percept-triplets (Planet-Sign-House with temporal states)
   - Angular relationships (aspects with verification weights)
   - MST translations (universal symbolic mappings)
   - Vector encodings (hybrid spherical-hyperbolic)

2. **Composite Structures**
   - Prototypes (weighted percept-triplet networks)
   - Focus spaces (conceptual workspaces)
   - Pattern templates (reusable configurations)
   - Aspect networks (validated relationships)

3. **Complex Structures**
   - Books (narrative + structured data)
   - Conceptual demarcations (boundary definitions)
   - Knowledge networks (linked structures)
   - Temporal sequences (state progressions)

Incorporation of Shared Structures (2-19)
Hierarchy Integration: 
Beads encapsulate basic structures (e.g., percept-triplets, ~1.8 KB), composite structures (e.g., prototypes, ~5-10 KB), and evolve into complex structures (e.g., Books, ~1 MB) within life crystals.
Relationships: 
Vertical (e.g., percept-triplet to Book), horizontal (e.g., aspect networks across players), and diagonal (e.g., prototype to knowledge network) structures are mapped by CBOS, etched into spheres.
Glass Bead Tokens: 
Each structure type (basic, composite, complex) is a bead (~1.8 KB base), with privacy (e.g., private percept-triplets), temporal states (e.g., quantum prototypes), and validation (e.g., MST for Books), minted via Solana (2-19).
Creation and Evolution: 
Players input percept-triplets (e.g., "Mars-Virgo-10th"), nodes/temples synthesize Books, CBOS validates and clusters, life crystals evolve with new structures monthly (2-19).
Reader Display: 
Shows percept-triplets (e.g., "Mars-Virgo-10th"), aspect networks (e.g., trine at 120°), and Books, with privacy levels and attribution visible (2-19).
Conclusion
The hybrid Memorativa Pantheon System with shared structures creates a dynamic tapestry: nodes and temples generate percept-triplets, prototypes, and Books (2-19), CBOS crystallizes them into life crystals, and regional farms store them with failovers and backups. A single sphere (10 MB initial, ~100 MB after 10 years) holds a player’s cosmic and collaborative legacy, updatable monthly (30 seconds), accessible via a reader (~20-40 min scan). AstroFan’s "Mars in Virgo" life crystal—token in wallet, sphere in hand—grows with every shared structure, a validated, privacy-preserved bridge between human creativity and machine intelligence in Pantheon’s grand design.
