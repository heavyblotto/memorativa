# 2.8. Example encoding of an input using the percept-triplet method

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive example of how the Memorativa system processes a player input through the percept-triplet encoding method. It demonstrates the complete workflow from initial input to the creation of a conceptual Book, illustrating how the various components described in the previous sections work together to transform concrete player content into abstract conceptual structures. The example shows how a single input is processed through the Core Game flow (Section 2.2), encoded using the percept-triplet structure (Section 2.4), stored in a Glass Bead (Section 2.3), translated using the MST (Section 2.5), enhanced with Generative AI (Section 2.6), and integrated with the RAG system (Section 2.7).

## Main Content

### Player Input Definition

Following the player input process from Section 2.2, we define an **input** as:

- URL
- Title
- Description
- Player's reflection (optional context/thoughts)

For example:

- "URL": "link to a photo of an apple"
- "title": "Eve's temptation"
- "description": "The apple in mythology"
- "reflection": "I'm interested in how this symbol appears across different cultures"
  
Here the input is not simply an object (the apple), but a perception of the object conditioned by the observer's state and context, as reflected in the title, description, and player reflection.

### Percept Creation

Using the percept-triplet structure from Section 2.4, the Generative AI system (Section 2.6) maps the apple input to a specific hybrid triplet encoding:

- **Planet**: Venus (Archetypal Vector - "What")
- **Sign**: Libra (Expression Vector - "How")
- **House**: 9th (Mundane Vector - "Where")

This encoding represents the input in the hybrid spherical-hyperbolic space defined in Section 2.4, with these specific coordinates:
- θ (theta): 2.618 radians (Venus archetypal angle)
- φ (phi): 0.524 radians (Libra expression elevation)
- r (radius): 0.889 (9th house mundane magnitude)
- κ (kappa): 1.0 (Hyperbolic curvature for mythological content)

### Symbolic Translation

Following the Memorativa Symbolic Translator (MST) approach from Section 2.5, the system generates a conceptual **Book** that includes the structure and an analysis:

#### Symbolic Analysis

- The structure encapsulates the apple as a symbol of temptation (Venus), expressed through the duality of choice (Libra). The 9th House places the apple within a mythological framework.

#### Justification via Correspondence Tables

Using the correspondence tables from Section 2.5:

- The apple as a symbol of temptation aligns with Venusian themes of desire, beauty, and value.

- Venus in Libra emphasizes the duality of choice (Eve's decision) and the balance between innocence and knowledge.

- The 9th House dominance places the apple within the realm of mythology, belief systems, and philosophical inquiry.

#### Cultural Neutralization

Through the cultural neutralization process (Section 2.5), the title and description from the input are transformed into:

- **Title**: "Ethical Choices in Cultural Narratives"  
- **Description**: "Examines how societies negotiate the balance between knowledge acquisition and moral boundaries through symbolic representations"

This translation removes explicit astrological terminology while preserving the core conceptual meaning, as described in Section 2.5.

### Technical flow

Here's how the system processes the apple example through its components, integrating all aspects of Sections 2.2-2.7:

### Processing steps

1. **Input Processing & Glass Bead Initialization** (Section 2.2, 2.3)
```python
input = {
    "url": "link to apple photo",
    "title": "Eve's temptation",
    "description": "The apple in mythology",
    "reflection": "I'm interested in how this symbol appears across different cultures"
}

# Initialize Glass Bead token with relative cost structure from Section 2.3
bead = GlassBead.create(
    owner=msg.sender,
    privacy_level=PrivacyLevel.Public,
    gas_cost=10  # Base GBT cost for creation from token economics
)
```

2. **Vector Encoding with Spatial Tracking** (Section 2.4)
```python
# Project input into hybrid spherical-hyperbolic space as defined in Section 2.4
triplet = HybridTriplet(
    theta=2.618,  # Venus archetypal angle 
    phi=0.524,    # Libra expression elevation
    radius=0.889, # 9th house mundane magnitude
    curvature=1.0 # Hyperbolic geometry for mythological content
)

# Calculate poincare coordinates for hyperbolic relationships
poincare_coords = triplet.spherical_to_poincare()

# Update Glass Bead spatial coordinates with both representations
bead.update_spatial_position(
    spherical=triplet.spherical,
    poincare=poincare_coords,
    gas_cost=2  # Token economic cost for coordinate update
)
```

3. **Percept-Triplet Formation with Spherical Merkle Verification** (Section 2.3, 2.4)
```python
# Calculate archetypal correlations using correspondence tables from Section 2.5
planet = calculate_planet_correlation(triplet)  # Venus
sign = calculate_sign_correlation(triplet)      # Libra
house = calculate_house_correlation(triplet)    # 9th

percept = PerceptTriplet(
    archetype=planet,  # What: Venus (desire/value)
    expression=sign,   # How: Libra (choice/balance)
    mundane=house      # Where: 9th (philosophy/belief)
)

# Create Spherical Merkle Node for the percept as defined in Section 2.3
merkle_node = SphericalMerkleNode(data=percept.serialize())

# Find related percepts for angular relationships
# Using RAG system's angle computation and significance detection from Section 2.7
rag = SphericalRAG()
related_percepts = rag.find_angular_related_documents(triplet)

for related_id, related_triplet, angle in related_percepts:
    # Only add significant angular relationships
    if is_significant_hybrid_aspect(angle, triplet.curvature):
        merkle_node.add_angular_relationship(related_id, angle)

# Add percept to Glass Bead's Spherical Merkle Tree with version tracking from Section 2.3
bead.add_component(
    component=percept,
    merkle_node=merkle_node,
    angular_proof=SphericalMerkleProof.create(merkle_node),
    gas_cost=3  # GBT cost for Merkle update
)

# Implement version compression techniques from Section 2.3
bead.compress_history(
    adaptive_snapshot=true,
    reference_counting=true,
    batch_updates=true
)
```

4. **Symbolic Translation System Integration** (Section 2.5)
```python
# Integrate with RAG Merkle system for data integrity
rag_merkle = RAGMerkleIntegrator(knowledge_base)
rag_merkle.index_document(percept, triplet)

# Apply MST process from Section 2.5 for cultural neutralization
mst = MemorativaSymbolicTranslator()

# Convert astrological to universal symbols with cultural neutralization and privacy checks
universal = mst.translate(
    percept,
    privacy_level=bead.privacy_level,
    correspondence_tables=cultural_correspondence_tables,
    neutralization_level=0.85  # High level of cultural neutralization
)

title = universal.generate_title()
description = universal.generate_description()

# Update Glass Bead metadata
bead.update_metadata(
    title=title,
    description=description,
    gas_cost=1  # GBT cost for metadata update
)
```

5. **Book Generation and Focus Space Creation** (Section 2.2, 2.6, 2.7)
```python
# Create focus space for conceptual workspace as described in Section 2.2
focus_space = FocusSpace.create(
    glass_bead=bead,
    chart_config=ChartConfig(
        show_aspects=True,
        highlight_venus_libra=True
    ),
    inner_cosmos_position=player.determine_cosmos_position(triplet),  # Integration into player's knowledge space
    gas_cost=5  # GBT cost for focus space creation
)

# Use RAG system for contextual retrieval as described in Section 2.7
spatial_context_generator = SpatialContextGenerator(rag)
relevant_context = spatial_context_generator.generate_with_context(triplet)

# Apply multi-modal analysis from Section 2.6
if "image" in input["url"]:
    visual_analysis = generative_ai.analyze_visual_content(
        input["url"],
        keyword_hints=["apple", "mythology", "temptation"]
    )
    relevant_context.extend(visual_analysis)

# Generate comprehensive analysis with retrieved context using Generative AI from Section 2.6
book = Book.create(
    percept=percept,
    universal_symbols=universal,
    temporal_state="quantum",  # Mythological time
    privacy_level="public",
    glass_bead_ref=bead.id,  # Link to source Glass Bead
    focus_space_ref=focus_space.id,  # Link to workspace
    rag_context=relevant_context,  # Include RAG-retrieved context
    ai_model="GenerativeAI-v2.6"  # Reference to Generative AI model from Section 2.6
)

# Update Glass Bead with Book and focus space references
bead.add_references(
    book_id=book.id,
    focus_space_id=focus_space.id,
    gas_cost=2  # GBT cost for reference updates
)

# Configure focus space visualization with performance optimizations
focus_space.configure_chart(
    title_filter="Ethical Choice Patterns",
    aspect_highlight=[
        "venus_libra_conjunction",
        "ninth_house_aspects"
    ],
    use_optimized_retrieval=True,  # Enable RAG optimizations
    inner_cosmos_visibility=true,   # Show connections to other concepts in player's cosmos
    gas_cost=1  # GBT cost for visualization update
)

# Award player according to game mechanics in Section 2.2
player.award_engagement_points(
    contribution_type="new_percept",
    quality_score=book.quality_assessment(),
    uniqueness_factor=bead.uniqueness_in_cosmos()
)
```

This structured output enables:
- Clear tracing from input to abstract concept (Section 2.2)
- Precise spatial positioning in the knowledge space (Section 2.4)
- Verifiable data integrity through Spherical Merkle Tree proofs (Section 2.3)
- Preservation of angular relationships between concepts (Section 2.4)
- Interactive analysis through focus space (Section 2.2)
- Privacy-aware sharing and retrieval (Section 2.3)
- Hybrid verification of both content and spatial relationships (Section 2.3)
- Efficient retrieval through RAG system optimizations (Section 2.7)
- Integration into the player's inner cosmos (Section 2.2)
- Cultural neutralization of domain-specific concepts (Section 2.5)
- Multi-modal analysis of different input types (Section 2.6)

## Key Points

- The percept-triplet method transforms concrete inputs into abstract conceptual structures following the Core Game flow, creating a bridge between human meaning-making and machine-readable formats [1]

- Each input is encoded as a Planet (core essence), Sign (mode of expression), and House (context/domain) as defined in the Percept-Triplet structure, providing a fixed-dimensional representation that maintains computational efficiency while preserving semantic relationships [2]

- The encoding process preserves both literal content and deeper symbolic/archetypal meanings by mapping inputs into hybrid spherical-hyperbolic space, allowing for both hierarchical organization and angular relationships to be represented simultaneously [3]

- Spherical Merkle Trees maintain both hierarchical data integrity and angular relationships as described in Glass Beads, ensuring verifiable storage while preserving the spatial properties of the percept-triplet [4]

- The RAG system leverages both spatial proximity and symbolic relationships for contextually relevant retrieval, enriching the generated Book with knowledge that maintains meaningful semantic connections to the original input [5]

- The MST process transforms domain-specific terminology into culturally-neutral language through correspondence tables, creating outputs that preserve meaning while removing astrological terminology [6]

- Generative AI provides multi-modal analysis and contextual bridging between different symbolic systems, enabling the system to process various input types while maintaining consistent conceptual encoding [7]

- The focus space integrates the concept into the player's inner cosmos, organizing related concepts into a navigable conceptual workspace that grows with each new input [8]

- Token economics govern all operations with a relative cost structure, creating sustainable incentives for quality contributions while preventing system abuse [9]

- Performance optimizations including spatial clustering, aspect caching, and batch processing improve efficiency, enabling the system to scale while maintaining responsiveness [10]

- The system generates new titles and descriptions that capture the abstracted meaning through cultural neutralization, transforming domain-specific concepts into universally accessible language [11]

- This structured encoding enables systematic organization and retrieval of knowledge in curved conceptual space, addressing the curse of dimensionality through the three-vector approach [12]

## Key Math

The example encoding process relies on several key mathematical foundations:

- **Hybrid Geometric Encoding**: The percept-triplet is encoded in a 4-coordinate system (θ, φ, r, κ) where:
  
  ```
  θ ∈ [0, 2π) represents the archetypal angle (Venus = 2.618)
  φ ∈ [-π/2, π/2] represents the expression elevation (Libra = 0.524)
  r ∈ [0, 1] represents the mundane radius (9th House = 0.889)
  κ ∈ [-K, K] represents the curvature parameter (Mythological = 1.0)
  ```

- **Aspect Calculation**: The angular relationship between percepts is calculated as:
  
  ```
  angle(p₁, p₂) = arccos(sin(φ₁)sin(φ₂) + cos(φ₁)cos(φ₂)cos(θ₁-θ₂))
  ```
  
  This allows the system to identify significant aspects like trines (120°) and sextiles (60°).

- **Hybrid Distance Function**: The distance between percepts in hybrid space combines spherical and hyperbolic components:
  
  ```
  d(p₁, p₂) = w·dₕ(p₁, p₂) + (1-w)·dₛ(p₁, p₂)
  ```
  
  where w is determined by the curvature parameter κ.

- **Merkle Hash Preservation**: The coordinate-preserving hash function combines content and spatial data:
  
  ```
  H(p) = hash_combine(hash_data(content), hash_data(angular_relationships))
  ```

## Key Visual Insights

The workflow diagram (Figure 1) illustrates several important insights about the Memorativa system:

- The complete transformation path from raw input to structured knowledge is shown, revealing how each component of the system contributes to the overall process
- The bidirectional relationships between subsystems highlight how information flows throughout the architecture, with RAG providing context to Book generation while receiving percept-triplet data
- The hierarchical organization of components like Glass Beads, Focus Space, and Symbolic Translation shows the layered architecture that enables both modularity and integration
- The spatial positioning of Vector Space and RAG Integration components suggests their foundational role in connecting semantic meaning with computational efficiency
