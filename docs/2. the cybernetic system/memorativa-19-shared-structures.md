# 19. Shared structures

Memorativa's shared structures represent the fundamental constructs that can be shared, verified, and evolved within the system through Glass Bead tokens. Each structure is encapsulated as a Glass Bead token with specific privacy controls, temporal states, and validation requirements.

## Structure hierarchy

1. **Basic Structures**
   - Percept-triplets (Planet-Sign-House with temporal states)
   - Angular relationships (aspects with verification weights)
   - MST translations (universal symbolic mappings)
   - Vector encodings (hybrid spherical-hyperbolic)

2. **Composite Structures**
   - Prototypes (weighted percept-triplet networks)
   - Focus spaces (conceptual workspaces)
   - Pattern templates (reusable configurations)
   - Aspect networks (validated relationships)

3. **Complex Structures**
   - Books (narrative + structured data)
   - Conceptual demarcations (boundary definitions)
   - Knowledge networks (linked structures)
   - Temporal sequences (state progressions)

## Structure relationships

1. **Vertical Integration**

   - Pattern emergence with validation
   - Conceptual transformation with privacy
   - Knowledge synthesis with attribution

## Glass bead encapsulation

1. **Token Structures**
   - Percept-triplet tokens with privacy levels

   - Book tokens with attribution data

2. **Structure States**
