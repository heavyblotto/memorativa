# 2.17. Natal Glass Bead

The Natal Glass Bead functions as a player's core identity token within Memorativa, while maintaining strict privacy preservation. Like a personal signet or cryptographic key, this special token provides pseudo-anonymous identification and authentication while enabling personalized meaning construction.

## Identity Functions

1. **Pseudo-Anonymous Identifier**
   - Functions as player's primary system identity
   - Enables authentication without revealing personal data
   - Supports selective disclosure through zero-knowledge proofs
   - Maintains separation between on-chain and off-chain identity

2. **Limited Fungibility**
   - Transfer requires complex ritual and high gas costs
   - Limited to exceptional circumstances (account recovery, inheritance)
   - Maintains strong binding to original player's patterns
   - Transfer history permanently recorded in bead structure

## Core functions

1. **Reference Template**
   - Acts as player's canonical reference structure with encrypted base state
   - Provides consistent angular relationships through secure proofs
   - Enables personal meaning calibration with privacy preservation
   - Maintains interpretive continuity through versioned access controls
   - Utilizes Spherical Merkle Trees to preserve spatial relationships
   - Stores both hierarchical data and angular relationships between nodes

2. **Activity Logging**
   - Records all player transactions and interactions
   - Maintains timestamped activity history
   - Tracks token creation, transfers, and burns
   - Logs focus space interactions and Book contributions
   - Preserves collaboration history and validation activities
   - Enables activity analysis and pattern recognition
   - Secures versioned history with Spherical Merkle Trees

3. **Structural Integration**
   - Can be superimposed with authorized structures only
   - Provides zero-knowledge proofs for pattern matching
   - Influences pattern recognition through permissioned channels
   - Shapes prototype formation with privacy-aware templates
   - Maintains angular relationships using Spherical Merkle Nodes
   - Enables hybrid verification of both content and spatial relationships

## Gas Token Integration

The Natal Glass Bead requires specific Gas Bead Token (GBT) allocations for its unique operations:

### Economic Model
- Higher initial cost reflects foundational importance
- Reduced activity logging costs encourage regular use
- Premium pricing for template modifications ensures stability
- Special rates for long-term crystal storage
- Bulk discounts available for regular state updates
- Additional fees for complex Spherical Merkle operations

        }
        
        // Update node hash to include both data and relationships
        node.update_hash();
        
        node
    }
    
    pub fn verify_structural_integrity(&self) -> Result<bool> {
        // Get current state as Spherical Merkle Node
        let current_node = self.create_spherical_merkle_node();
        
        // Retrieve reference template
        let template_node = self.reference_template.merkle_node();
        
        // Create hybrid verifier
        let verifier = HybridVerifier::new();
        
        // Verify both content and angular relationships
        verifier.verify(
            current_node,
            template_node,
            self.create_private_proof()
        )
