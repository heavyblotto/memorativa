# 2.17. Natal Glass Bead

The Natal Glass Bead functions as a player's core identity token within Memorativa, while maintaining strict privacy preservation. Like a personal signet or cryptographic key, this special token provides pseudo-anonymous identification and authentication while enabling personalized meaning construction.

## Identity Functions

1. **Pseudo-Anonymous Identifier**
   - Functions as player's primary system identity
   - Enables authentication without revealing personal data
   - Supports selective disclosure through zero-knowledge proofs
   - Maintains separation between on-chain and off-chain identity

2. **Limited Fungibility**
   - Transfer requires complex ritual and high gas costs
   - Limited to exceptional circumstances (account recovery, inheritance)
   - Maintains strong binding to original player's patterns
   - Transfer history permanently recorded in bead structure

## Core functions

1. **Reference Template**
   - Acts as player's canonical reference structure with encrypted base state
   - Provides consistent angular relationships through secure proofs
   - Enables personal meaning calibration with privacy preservation
   - Maintains interpretive continuity through versioned access controls

2. **Activity Logging**
   - Records all player transactions and interactions
   - Maintains timestamped activity history
   - Tracks token creation, transfers, and burns
   - Logs focus space interactions and Book contributions
   - Preserves collaboration history and validation activities
   - Enables activity analysis and pattern recognition

3. **Structural Integration**
   - Can be superimposed with authorized structures only
   - Provides zero-knowledge proofs for pattern matching
   - Influences pattern recognition through permissioned channels
   - Shapes prototype formation with privacy-aware templates

## Gas Token Integration

The Natal Glass Bead requires specific Gas Bead Token (GBT) allocations for its unique operations:

### Economic Model
- Higher initial cost reflects foundational importance
- Reduced activity logging costs encourage regular use
- Premium pricing for template modifications ensures stability
- Special rates for long-term crystal storage
- Bulk discounts available for regular state updates

### Implementation
```rust
impl NatalBead {
    pub fn create_new(gas: &mut GasBeadToken) -> Result<Self> {
        // Verify sufficient gas for identity creation
        gas.verify_balance(1000)?;
        
        // Generate unique identifier
        let identifier = Self::generate_unique_id();
        
        // Initialize identity proof structure
        let identity_proof = Self::create_identity_proof(identifier);
        
        // Burn gas for operation
        gas.burn_for_operation(Operation::CreateIdentityBead)?;
        
        // Initialize natal bead structure with identity
        Self::initialize_natal_structure(identifier, identity_proof)
    }
    
    pub fn transfer_ownership(&mut self, gas: &mut GasBeadToken, new_owner: Address) -> Result<()> {
        // Verify sufficient gas and ritual completion
        gas.verify_balance(500)?;
        self.verify_transfer_ritual()?;
        
        // Update ownership while preserving history
        self.transfer_to(new_owner)
    }
}
```

### Storage architecture

1. **Crystal Encoding**
   - Natal bead structure encoded as 5D voxels in quartz crystal
   - Uses femtosecond laser pulses to create nanogratings
   - Spatial dimensions (x,y,z) encode percept-triplet vectors
   - Optical dimensions (intensity, polarization) encode relationships
   - Multiple layers provide redundancy and versioning

2. **Physical Structure** 
   - Spherical quartz crystal beads (1-2mm diameter)
   - Surface etched with unique identifier
   - Organized in 3D grid arrays for efficient access
   - Position corresponds to knowledge graph location
   - Protected storage environment with climate control
