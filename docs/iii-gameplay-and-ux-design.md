# Memorativa: Part III: Gameplay and User Experience Design
The user experience is designed to be a workshop of ideas, concepts, and relationships, with an added layer of playfulness and game mechanics. Although future expansion lends itself and may include a more immersive, three-dimensional or even virtual reality experience, the current design is focused on a two-dimensional, web-based experience. Moreover, the system is intended to cultivate an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships, and to rely less on mechanisms that can lead to the externalization of thought.
