- Use Markdown for all documentation.
- As I provide ideas that need refining or clarification, we will arrive at acceptable output and add it to the design.md document, making sure to read the document first, look for where the output should go, and then add it.
- Always read the codebase and documentation before adding to the design.md document.
- the 'drafts' folder is for ideas that are not yet ready for the design.md document.
- don't delete or destroy without asking.
- don't presume, invent, or assume anything. Always ask for clarification.
- tell me when you're wrong, can't do something, or when you're stuck. Don't make up answers.
- when you solve for technical solutions, always build on top of the existing codebase.
- make sure that as we add new sections or content to the design doc, you analyze the codebase and the documentation to make sure we update all required sections.
