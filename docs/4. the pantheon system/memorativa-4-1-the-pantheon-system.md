# 4.1. The Pantheon System

Now that the Memorativa model has described the components of the cybernetic and machine systems, we can begin to better instantiate the various virtual biological systems and states that emerged from constructing the machine systems.

While the cybernetic systems descriptions of part two provide a good amount of technical description to anchor the system into a workable device, the technical descriptions of the machine systems were less defined and more conceptually bounded. 

Now we will consider a new overarching Pantheon system to more clearly define the overall systems implementation in a more distributed and scalable architecture.
