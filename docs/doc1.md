# Memorativa - A Cross-System Symbolic Correspondence Engine, Synchronicity Engine, and Game

## Overview

**Memorativa** is the application that automatically organizes and curates online content using customizable and extensible open-source DMPs. **IDOLUM (interactive digital organization & learning using memorativa)** is a cross-system symbolic correspondence engine that enables users in the DMP to organize and understand online content using symbolic correspondences, relationships, and patterns. **Idolum** is the name of the engine and the AI agent (the **Idolum Daemon**) that uses the engine to organize and understand online content, and the space that contains the DMPs.

The **Digital Memory Palace (DMP)** is a new approach to an ancient way to organize and understand the world's content. A DMP enables users enter a digital memory palace where they review, organize, and understand online content using symbolic correspondences, relationships, and patterns within the context of a virtual space.

Memes, images, videos, notes, art, news, books, film, music, learning, reference works, and other content are extracted from linked data and represented and organized in the DMP as **reflexions**, which is content that has been organized, categorized, and cultivated (using AI and data collections) by DMP + the user. It is content that is imbued and encoded with the user's own memory and symbolic logic, and that takes on meaning from the DPM experience. Glass beads are the tokens that represent the reflexions in the DMP.

The DMP is explored and understood through the use of symbolic **lenses**. Lenses organize various symbolic systems (such as I-Ching, Tarot, Astrology, Alchemy, etc.) and enable the user to explore the DMP through different perspectives.

The **Glass Bead Game** operates within the Idolum space as both a reward mechanism and a way to cultivate reflexions into a personal cosmos. Through the Vitrium Orbis Token ($VOGB) system, each glass bead's properties and interactions are influenced by celestial mechanics calculated via Swiss Ephemeris.

## Background and inspiration

Memorativa's user experience, idolum engine, and organizational frameworks (lenses) take their inspiration from the *ars memorativa* and the *idolum*.

> ***Memorativa***,
> the **Art of Memory** (*ars memorativa* in Latin) - a set of mnemonic principles and techniques for organizing and recalling information.
>
> ***Idolum***, (or *idolum mentis*) in the context of the art of memory refers to:
>
> - a concept that functions as a mediating force between pure thought and physical reality
> - the imaginative faculty that creates and manipulates memory images
> - an active force in cognition (not just passive storage) that facilitates the understanding of correspondences and relationships

***The Glass Bead Game***, is the *game of memorativa* that is played for the purpose of constellating and cultivating reflexions into a *cosmos*. Based on Hermann Hesse's novel, the game represents the highest form of intellectual synthesis.

> ***Cosmos*** is the *ornamentum mentis* (the ornament of the mind), which is the dynamic image (reflexion) of the world in the mind. The discovery of synthesis and synchronicities is the goal of the game.

## Memorativa model

```text
--[Memorativa: application]
  |
  |--[Idolum: space]
  |  |
  |  |--[DMP: architecture]
  |  |  |
  |  |  |--[Reflexions: content]
  |  |  |--[Lenses: filter]
  |  |  |--[Glass Beads: rewards and token system]
  |  |  |
  |  |--[Cosmos: image]
```

In Memorativa, the user enters the **idolum** space. The core space of the idolum is a circular, domed room that can be viewed orthographically or perspectively.

In this model, it is possible to build multiple DMPs in the same idolum. Users navigate between DMPs without leaving the idolum.

## Digital Memory Palace (DMP)

### Storage Architecture

#### Distributed Content Model

- Content remains at source where possible
- Links and references stored instead of content
- Local caching for performance
- Distributed storage for user-uploaded media
- No direct storage of large media files

#### Content Sources

- Links to original content
- X.com posts via API
- Web content via URLs
- Local files via hash references
- IPFS/Arweave for distributed storage
- User's local storage for media

#### Data Storage Tiers

- On-chain:
  - Token metadata
  - Birth charts
  - Ownership history
  - Core relationships
  - Smart contract state
  
- Distributed Storage (IPFS/Arweave):
  - Generated seals
  - Relationship maps
  - Public metadata
  - Shared content hashes
  - Lens definitions
  - Generated images
  
- Local Storage:
  - Personal media files
  - Private annotations
  - Local configurations
  - Cached content
  - Offline data
  - Local AI models

- Backend Services:
  - Index data
  - Cache layer
  - Analytics
  - Non-PII user preferences
  - System metadata
  - AI model states

#### Privacy & Data Protection

- No storage of PII
- Content references only
- Local encryption for private data
- Distributed storage for shared content
- User controls data location
- Optional self-hosting capability
