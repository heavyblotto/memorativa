# Memorativa - A Cross-System Symbolic Correspondence Engine

## Overview

The **digital memory palace (DMP)** is a new approach to an ancient way to organize and understand the world's content. A DMP enables users enter a digital memory palace where they review, organize, and understand online content using symbolic correspondences, relationships, and patterns within the context of a physical (digital) space.

**Memorativa** is an application that automatically organizes and curates online content using customizable and extensible open-source DMP. **IDOLUM (interactive digital organization & learning using memorativa)** is a cross-system symbolic correspondence engine that enables users in the DMP to organize and understand online content using symbolic correspondences, relationships, and patterns. **Idolum** is the name of the engine, the AI agent (the **Idolum Daemon**) that uses the engine to organize and understand online content, and the space that contains the DMPs.

Memes, images, videos, notes, art, news, books, film, music, learning, reference works, and other content are extracted from linked data and represented and organized in the DMP as **reflections**, which is content that has been organized, categorized, and curated by DMP. The DMP is explored and understood through the use of symbolic **lenses**.

Memorativa's user experience, idolum engine, and organizational frameworks (lenses) take their inspiration from the *ars memorativa* and the *idolum*.

> ***Memorativa***,
> the **art of memory** (*ars memorativa* in Latin) - a set of mnemonic principles and techniques for organizing and recalling information.
>
> ***Idolum***, (or *idolum mentis*) in the context of the art of memory refers to:
>
> - a concept that functions as a mediating force between pure thought and physical reality
> - the imaginative faculty that creates and manipulates memory images
> - an active force in cognition (not just passive storage) that facilitates the understanding of correspondences and relationships
