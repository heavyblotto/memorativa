# Memorativa - A Cross-System Symbolic Correspondence Engine

## Overview

The **digital memory palace (DMP)** is a new approach to an ancient way to organize and understand the world's content. A DMP enables users enter a digital memory palace where they review, organize, and understand online content using symbolic correspondences, relationships, and patterns within the context of a virtual space.

**Memorativa** is an application that automatically organizes and curates online content using customizable and extensible open-source DMP. **IDOLUM (interactive digital organization & learning using memorativa)** is a cross-system symbolic correspondence engine that enables users in the DMP to organize and understand online content using symbolic correspondences, relationships, and patterns. **Idolum** is the name of the engine and the AI agent (the **Idolum Daemon**) that uses the engine to organize and understand online content, and the space that contains the DMPs.

Memes, images, videos, notes, art, news, books, film, music, learning, reference works, and other content are extracted from linked data and represented and organized in the DMP as **reflexions**, which is content that has been organized, categorized, and cultivated (using AI and data collections) by DMP + the user. It is content that is imbued and encoded with the user's own memory and symbolic logic, and that takes on meaning from the DPM experience.

The DMP is explored and understood through the use of symbolic **lenses**. Lenses organize various symbolic systems (such as I-Ching, Tarot, Astrology, Alchemy, etc.) and enable the user to explore the DMP through different perspectives.

The **Glass Bead Game** is the game of memorativa that is played for the purpose of organizing and understanding reflexions. The game is played passively by the user who is awarded rewards for their participation.

***Glass beads*** are tokens (ERC-20) that are awarded to the user for their participation in the DMP. Glass beads are initially clear and inactive. Inactive glass beads can be used as "currency" in the game.

Some beads are Sun beads, others are based on the other seven planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. A sun bead is a general purpose bead that can be used for any purpose. Other beads are more specialized and are based on the properties of the planets.

Beads are generated by the Idolum Daemon based on planetary cycles and the user's horoscope.

Active glass beads are assigned to reflexions and contain metadata, categorization, analysis, synthetic content (summaries, etc), relationships and mapping, horoscopes, seals, and other properties associated with the submitted content.

The goal of the game is to:

- Constellate (gather and organize) the reflexions into a coherent and meaningful structure: "To make a starry sky of one's consciousness"
- Cultivate (review and grow)the ecology of the reflexions: "ecology of the soul" (the ecology of the reflexions)
- Forge ***imago*** to build a **cosmos**: an overall image of understanding comprised of synthetic symbolic imagery (***imago***): cognitive unity (cf. Rudolf Steiner's Monistic Thinking)

***Glass beads*** are activated by the Idolum Daemon when a new reflexion is added to the idolum. Glass beads can be combined (without loss of the glass bead) with other glass beads into synthetic collections. Glass beads are made up of:

- Single or combined horoscopes (circular charts that show the arrangement of planets and celestial bodies for a given date, time, and location) that are generated and applied to reflexions and users.
- Symbolic correspondences (such as the I-Ching, Tarot, Astrology, Alchemy, etc.) that are generated and applied to reflexions and users.
- ***Seals***, that are single static symbolic images that are generated at the creation of the glass bead by the Idolum Daemon and applied once to the glass bead.
- Synthetic content (summaries, etc) that are generated and applied to reflexions and users.
- Relationships and mapping (e.g. between reflexions, users, and other content) that are generated and applied to reflexions and users.
- Metadata (e.g. date, time, location, etc.) that are generated and applied to reflexions and users.
- Divinatory operations (e.g. I-Ching, Tarot, Astrology, Alchemy, etc.) that are generated and applied to reflexions and users.

Glass beads can be synthetically forged into ***imago***, that are unique symbolic images generated by the Idolum Daemon. Synthetic forging does not destroy the glass bead. Synthetic forging is a process of combining the glass bead with other glass beads or glass bead properties (e.g. time, location, or date) and with a divinatory (i.e.symbolic and random) operation (in time and space).

Quests are tasks that the user can complete to earn glass beads. Quests are generated by the Idolum Daemon based on the user's horoscope (combination of aspects and cycles) and the current state of the DMP.

Imago can be influenced by the dynamic influences of the DMP.

Imagos serve as and grow into ornaments, tokens, and memory stations for users to interact with the DMP. They are organic, dynamic seeds that grow into a ***cosmos***.

Glass beads take the symbolic colors and patterns of the reflexion or reflexions they are made from.

The ***Glass Bead Game Engine (GBG Engine)*** employs an ephemeris engine (Swiss Ephemeris) to generate horoscopes and symbolic correspondences. The engine is also used to generate ***seals*** and ***imago***, employing various AI models.

## Background and inspiration

Memorativa's user experience, idolum engine, and organizational frameworks (lenses) take their inspiration from the *ars memorativa* and the *idolum*.

> ***Memorativa***,
> the **art of memory** (*ars memorativa* in Latin) - a set of mnemonic principles and techniques for organizing and recalling information.
>
> ***Idolum***, (or *idolum mentis*) in the context of the art of memory refers to:
>
> - a concept that functions as a mediating force between pure thought and physical reality
> - the imaginative faculty that creates and manipulates memory images
> - an active force in cognition (not just passive storage) that facilitates the understanding of correspondences and relationships

***The Glass Bead Game***, is the *game of memorativa* that is played for the purpose of constellating and cultivating reflexions into a *cosmos*. Based on Hermann Hesse's novel, the game represents the highest form of intellectual synthesis.

> ***Cosmos*** is the *ornamentum mentis* (the ornament of the mind), which is the dynamic image (reflexion) of the world in the mind.

## Memorativa model

In Memorativa, the user enters the **idolum** space. The core space of the idolum is a circular, domed room that can be viewed orthographically or perspectively.

In this model, it is possible to build multiple DMPs in the same idolum. Users navigate between DMPs without leaving the idolum.
