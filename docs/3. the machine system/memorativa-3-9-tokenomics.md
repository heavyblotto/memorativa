# 3.9. Enhanced Tokenomics

The enhanced tokenomics model extends Memorativa's dual token system to fully support multi-modal content, cross-modal aspects, and enhanced temporal states. This design maintains the core economic principles while enabling richer token utility across the expanded system capabilities.

## Token Model Overview

The system maintains two primary token types:

1. **Glass Bead Tokens (GBTk)**
   - Knowledge artifacts representing verified human thought
   - Enhanced multi-modal content support
   - Cross-modal aspect relationships
   - Rich temporal state handling

2. **Gas Bead Tokens (GBT)**
   - Utility tokens powering system operations
   - Multi-modal processing costs
   - Cross-modal aspect calculations
   - Enhanced temporal state transitions

        "text": natal_bead.text_expertise / 100,
        "visual": natal_bead.visual_expertise / 100,
        "music": natal_bead.music_expertise / 100
    }
    
    # Apply modal-specific multipliers based on proposal type
    if proposal.is_multi_modal():
        power = base_power * sum([
            modal_multipliers[mode] for mode in proposal.modalities
        ]) / len(proposal.modalities)
    else:
        power = base_power * modal_multipliers[proposal.primary_modality]
    
    # Apply temporal state adjustments

    base_rep = sum([
        contribution.quality_score * contribution.complexity
        for contribution in natal_bead.contributions
    ])
    
    # Apply modality-specific weights
    modal_rep = {
        "text": sum([c.quality_score for c in natal_bead.text_contributions]),
        "visual": sum([c.quality_score for c in natal_bead.visual_contributions]),
        "music": sum([c.quality_score for c in natal_bead.music_contributions])
    }
    
    # Add cross-modal bonuses
    cross_modal_bonus = calculate_cross_modal_synergy(natal_bead)
    
    # Apply time decay and consistency factors
    time_factor = calculate_time_decay(natal_bead)
    consistency = calculate_contribution_consistency(natal_bead)
    
    return (base_rep + sum(modal_rep.values()) + cross_modal_bonus) * time_factor * consistency
```

### Qualification Requirements
- **Magister Ludi**: 90+ reputation with expertise in all modalities

    # Verify Magister Ludi status
    if not natal_bead.has_role(Role.MAGISTER_LUDI):
        return False
        
    # Check modality-specific expertise requirements
    if action_type.affected_modality and natal_bead.get_expertise(action_type.affected_modality) < 85:
        return False
        
    # Verify minimum cross-modal expertise for multi-modal emergencies
    if action_type.is_cross_modal and natal_bead.cross_modal_expertise < 80:
        return False
        
    # Confirm temporal state handling capability
    if action_type.affects_temporal_state and natal_bead.temporal_expertise < 85:
