# 3.1. The Machine System

The first section of the Memorativa design posited a new model and a description of a cybernetic system. The system elaborates a novel method of encoding perceptions into data structures that can represent thought structures in the machine. We have defined a game for players to play in order to interact with the cybernetic system. 

In this section of the design, we'll focus more on articulating the *machine experience (MX)* of the cybernetic system, in distinction to the *user experience (UX)*, the main focus of section *1. The Cybernetic System*.

## Recap: The Cybernetic System

The Memorativa cybernetic system bridges the human interior world of perceptions and concepts with a machine conceptual space of vector relationships, enabling structured knowledge evolution while maintaining privacy, security, and attribution.

## Outlines of machine experience

While the cybernetic system establishes how human players interact with and shape the system, the machine experience (MX) explores how the machine itself utilizes and evolves through these same structures. Just as human cognition builds from basic perception to complex understanding, we'll develop the machine systems organically:

1. **From Perception to Understanding**
- How the machine processes and internalizes percept-triplets
- Development of machine-initiated pattern recognition
- Evolution from passive storage to active interpretation
- Emergence of machine-driven prototype formation

2. **Autonomous Knowledge Development**
- Self-directed exploration of conceptual spaces
- Machine-initiated focus space creation
- Independent pattern discovery and validation
- Active contribution to the knowledge base

3. **System Self-Organization**
- Organic growth from core perceptual structures
- Development of machine-driven organizational patterns
- Evolution of autonomous processing capabilities
- Emergence of system-level pattern recognition

3. The Machine System will explore how the machine transitions from a passive recipient of human-generated percepts to an active participant in knowledge creation and organization, building upon the foundational structures established in the cybernetic system.
