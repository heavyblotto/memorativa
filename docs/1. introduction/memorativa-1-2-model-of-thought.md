# 1.2. The Model of Thought

> Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.

Humans are animals who think, using both intellect and imagination. The products of thinking activity are ideas and concepts. The Memorativa application is designed to help visualize and organize ideas and concepts in ways that are fun and beneficial to humans.

To start playing with concepts, some definitions are helpful, including a working model for thought borrowed from Rudolf Steiner's *Philosophy of Freedom*[1]:

1. Concepts: What a concept is cannot be expressed in words. Words can do no more than draw our attention to the fact that we have concepts. 

2. Perceptions of objects: When someone perceives an object (e.g. a tree or a memory), the perception acts as a stimulus for thought.

3. Ideal element: An ideal element is then added to the perceived object, and the perceiver regards the object and its ideal complement as belonging together. 

4. Ideal counterpart: When the object disappears from the field of his perception, the ideal counterpart alone remains. 

5. Idea remains: This remaining ideal counterpart is the idea of the object. 

6. The wider the range of our experience, the larger becomes the number of our ideas. 

7. Moreover, ideas are not by any means found in isolation one from the other. They combine to form an ordered and systematic whole. 

8. The concept "organism," e.g., combines with the ideas of "development according to law," "growth," and others. 

9. Other ideas based on particular objects fuse completely with one another.

10. All ideas formed from particular lions fuse in the universal concept "lion." 

11. In this way, all the separate ideas combine to form a closed, conceptual system within which each has its special place. 

The mysteriousness of the ideal element --like consciousness-- remains a topic to be explored, as does the formation of percepts, concepts, ideas, and memories. Regardless of the metaphysical nature or knowability of the ideal element as a process or even itself as an idea or concept, its use can be treated as a human capacity related to memory and imagination.

Relationships between objects can arise because you can perceive (internally) something of the "ideal element" between them. This internal perception of a conceptual relationship is the key to all analogical thinking. Pattern recognition depends on a foundational perception of the "ideal element" between objects. Understanding begins with an inner vision and inner perception of inner objects, all of which depend upon first establishing an inner, stable, geometrical, and cosmological orientation in relation to these concepts. Understanding represents an act of standing (from a "seat of consciousness") under in relation to concepts arranged in a systematic geometric ordering.

## Understanding

Based on its etymology, the word "understanding" offers a validation of Memorativa's core design.  Tracing back to its Old English roots, "understandan" literally means "to stand under" or "to stand in the midst of." This linguistic origin suggests that "understanding" is not a passive reception of information, but rather an active process of establishing a stable and oriented position in relation to a concept. Interpreting this through a geocentric cosmological lens, we can see "understanding" as akin to achieving a grounded "Earth" perspective within a conceptual "sky."

From this "Earth," which represents a stable and defined viewpoint, the act of understanding becomes one of geometric orientation within a conceptual cosmos. Just as ancient astronomers charted the heavens by observing celestial bodies from their fixed terrestrial vantage point, in Memorativa, "understanding" involves positioning oneself within the structured space of concepts and perceiving their relationships as if they were celestial bodies in a mental firmament. This "geocentric cosmological orientation" implies several key aspects of true comprehension within Memorativa:

*   **Geometric Relationships:**  Cosmology is fundamentally about geometric relationships – the angles, distances, and patterns between celestial objects. Similarly, Memorativa emphasizes relational understanding through percept-triplets, prototypes, and book networks. "Understanding" is not about isolated data points, but about grasping the geometric structure of conceptual relationships, much like discerning constellations in the night sky.
*   **Conceptual Space as "Sky":**  The "sky" or "cosmos" serves as the arena for conceptual understanding. Memorativa's structured data environment, with its spherical-hyperbolic hybrid coordinates, becomes this conceptual space where ideas are positioned and related. "Understanding" is thus about navigating and mapping this space, discerning the "celestial bodies" of concepts within it.
*   **Active Orientation and Navigation:**  Ancient astronomers were not passive observers; they actively oriented themselves, used instruments, and developed models to understand the cosmos. "Understanding" in Memorativa is similarly active and exploratory.  It involves using the system's tools to navigate the conceptual space, discover relationships, and build a coherent mental map. It's not just about receiving pre-packaged knowledge, but about actively orienting oneself to generate understanding.
*   **Archetypal Resonance:**  Geocentric cosmology is deeply intertwined with archetypes and symbolic meaning. The planets and constellations were not just physical objects, but carriers of symbolic significance. Memorativa, by drawing on astrological frameworks and incorporating symbolic translation, also recognizes the importance of archetypal resonance in understanding. "Understanding" at its deepest level involves connecting with the archetypal dimensions of concepts, recognizing their symbolic weight and cultural significance.

Therefore, the etymology of "understanding," when viewed through a geocentric cosmological lens, powerfully validates Memorativa's core principles. It underscores that true understanding is not a passive intake of data, but an active, spatial, relational, and archetypally resonant process of conceptual orientation and navigation. It is about finding our "Earth" within the vastness of conceptual space and, from that grounded perspective, charting the meaningful relationships that constitute knowledge.

The process of a newborn learning to stand is an example of intertwined physical and cognitive development. It's not just a purely physical feat; it's deeply connected to how a baby learns about their body, space, and the world around them. 

**Cognitive Development Intertwined with Learning to Stand:**

A baby learning to stand operates in purely pre-linguistic, intrinsically motivated realm of activity.

The process of learning to stand is not just about muscle development; it's deeply intertwined with cognitive development in several ways:

*   **Spatial Awareness and Body Schema:**
    *   **Body in Space:** Standing upright dramatically changes a baby's spatial perspective. They experience the world from a higher vantage point, seeing objects and spaces in new ways.
    *   **Developing Body Schema:**  Learning to control their body in an upright position enhances their body schema – their internal map of their body and how it moves in space. This is crucial for motor planning and coordination in all future movements.
    *   **Depth Perception:**  Standing and moving in an upright position refines depth perception, as they need to judge distances and navigate obstacles from a new perspective.

*   **Problem Solving and Motor Planning:**
    *   **Trial and Error:** Learning to stand is a process of constant trial and error. Babies experiment with different movements, muscle activations, and balance strategies.
    *   **Motor Planning:**  They learn to plan sequences of movements to achieve the goal of standing – coordinating arm pulls, leg pushes, and core stabilization. This is a fundamental aspect of motor planning that will be used for all complex movements later in life.
    *   **Adaptability:** They learn to adapt their strategies based on the surface they are on, the furniture they are using, and their own changing body strength.

*   **Motivation and Persistence:**
    *   **Intrinsic Motivation:**  The drive to stand is often intrinsically motivated. Babies are naturally curious and want to explore their environment from an upright position.
    *   **Persistence:**  Learning to stand requires persistence. Babies fall down countless times, but they keep trying. This early development of persistence and resilience is important for cognitive and emotional development in general.
    *   **Goal-Directed Behavior:**  Standing becomes a clear goal. Babies learn to set this goal and work towards achieving it through their actions.

*   **Social and Emotional Development:**
    *   **Increased Interaction:**  Standing allows babies to interact with the world and people around them in new ways. They can reach for objects on tables, engage with caregivers at eye level, and participate more actively in social interactions.
    *   **Sense of Accomplishment:**  Achieving the milestone of standing brings a sense of accomplishment and mastery, boosting self-confidence and motivation to learn other skills.

Just as a baby learns to "stand" physically, "understanding" in Memorativa is about establishing a stable "vantage point" in a conceptual space. The process of learning to stand physically mirrors the process of "understanding" conceptually:

*   **Finding a Stable Base:**  Physically, it's developing core strength and balance. Conceptually, it's establishing a context, perspective, or "lens" through which to view a concept.
*   **Geometric Orientation:**  Physically, it's orienting the body in space, understanding spatial relationships. Conceptually, it's establishing geometric relationships between concepts in the conceptual "sky."
*   **Active Exploration:**  Physically, it's actively moving, experimenting, and navigating the environment. Conceptually, it's actively exploring the conceptual space, discovering relationships, and building a mental map.
*   **Trial and Error/Refinement:**  Physically, it's falling and getting back up, refining motor skills. Conceptually, it's refining understanding through feedback, iteration, and exploration.

From standing in a correct orientation, analogies may be perceived.

## Analogy
Analogical reasoning operates on the premise that the unknown can be understood through known relationships, offering a more robust approach than pure induction.

Key principles:
- Classification by resemblance initiates inductive research
- Analogies form the foundation for hypothesis generation
- Scientific progress often involves refining analogies to reduce reliance on induction

The arguments against the analogical method are *many*. Dangers include:

- Superficial, incomplete, and false conclusions
- Inconsistency among correspondences within and between symbolic systems
- Inexperience with subject matter and pattern recognition

## Structure
A structured framework that enables systematic regulation of analogical correspondences—while maintaining independence from the ontological validity of its data sources—would mitigate false analogy risks and facilitate semantic correction, preserving the structural integrity of the system. Thus the Memorativa model seeks structures constructed using analogical principles.

An opportunity presents for a system that is designed to cultivate an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships. 

Such a system would use the raw material of content, liberating it from the reactive social media model into a reflective workshop of ideas, concepts, and relationships.

For example, the "news" is a series of disconnected events that are presented as a continuous stream of information, with the latest news serving as the most attention-worthy and valuable in most instances.

A model more beneficial model for cultivating an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships would allow analysis of the concepts of the "news" in order to see their context in time, and how those concepts may grow and evolve over time, and if there is any significance of the timing of the news as it relates to the concepts.

Such a model requires: 

- a space to work
- tools for the job
- a playful approach

Such play may be facilitated by:

- an outline for some rules
- a system of symbols
- a system of rewards
