# 1.2. The Model of Thought

> Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.

Humans are animals who think, using both intellect and imagination. The products of thinking activity are ideas and concepts. The Memorativa application is designed to help visualize and organize ideas and concepts in ways that are fun and beneficial to humans.

To start playing with concepts, some definitions are helpful, including a working model for thought borrowed from Rudolf Steiner's *Philosophy of Freedom*[1]:

1. Concepts: What a concept is cannot be expressed in words. Words can do no more than draw our attention to the fact that we have concepts. 

2. Perceptions of objects: When someone perceives an object (e.g. a tree or a memory), the perception acts as a stimulus for thought.

3. Ideal element: An ideal element is then added to the perceived object, and the perceiver regards the object and its ideal complement as belonging together. 

4. Idea formation: The ideal counterpart remains after the object disappears from perception. This is the idea or abstraction of the object.

5. Conceptual system: Through widening experience, ideas combine to form an ordered and systematic whole.

This model of thought underpins the Memorativa cybernetic system, providing a framework for understanding how humans form and organize concepts.

## Understanding as Standing Under

The word "understanding" has rich etymological resonance for the Memorativa system. By breaking it into its component parts—"under" and "standing"—we can explore how the act of understanding is related to spatial orientation.

In its original sense, to "understand" meant to "stand in the midst of" or "stand under" something, suggesting a physical positioning that allows comprehensive perception[2]. This embodied nature of understanding is reflected in Memorativa's geocentric model, where the perceiver "stands at the center" of a conceptual cosmos.

From this stable center, the perceiver can observe and navigate geometric relationships between concepts, just as ancient astronomers observed and navigated the relationships between celestial bodies. This orientation transforms passive content consumption into active concept formation through four key processes:

1. **Stable Orientation**: Establishing a grounded perspectival "Earth" within conceptual space
2. **Geometric Relationships**: Perceiving angular and spatial connections between concepts
3. **Active Navigation**: Using system tools to explore and map the conceptual cosmos
4. **Archetypal Resonance**: Connecting with the symbolic dimensions of concepts

## Grounding in Cognitive Development

The Memorativa model of active understanding through geocentric orientation has parallels in human cognitive development[5]. Research in developmental psychology shows that:

- Physical orientation and stability are prerequisites for cognitive development in infants
- Spatial concepts are among the first abstract concepts children develop
- Understanding of abstract concepts is often grounded in spatial metaphors
- Navigation of physical space provides templates for navigation of conceptual space

This developmental pattern suggests that the Memorativa approach aligns with natural cognitive processes, providing a framework that builds on innate human capacities for spatial orientation and exploration.

## From Analysis to Synthesis

The model of thought implemented in Memorativa supports both analytical understanding (breaking concepts into components) and synthetic understanding (building new conceptual combinations). This dual capacity is facilitated through:

- **Analogical Reasoning**: Using structural similarities to map relationships between different conceptual domains
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring structures across different contexts
- **Conceptual Blending**: Creating new concepts by combining aspects of existing concepts
- **Hierarchical Integration**: Relating concepts within nested levels of abstraction and specificity

These cognitive operations are supported by the system's triplet structure, which provides a framework for encoding and relating concepts across different domains.

## The Game of Concepts

To make the abstract model of thought practically accessible, Memorativa implements a game framework inspired by Hesse's Glass Bead Game[7]. This framework includes:

- **Rules**: Structured procedures for encoding and relating concepts
- **Symbols**: A coherent system of meaning-laden tokens
- **Play**: Exploratory and creative interaction with concepts
- **Rewards**: Incentives for conceptual discovery and synthesis
- **Community**: Shared conceptual exploration and collaborative understanding

The game structure transforms abstract cognitive operations into tangible activities, making active understanding both accessible and enjoyable. It enables players to:

- Encode their perceptions into the system
- Explore conceptual relationships
- Discover unexpected connections
- Create new conceptual syntheses
- Share insights with other players

## Conceptual Cosmology

Just as ancient astronomers constructed models of the cosmos to navigate the physical world, Memorativa enables users to construct conceptual cosmologies to navigate the world of ideas. This approach:

- Centers the individual as the stable reference point for understanding
- Maps concepts as objects in a navigable space
- Relates concepts through angular and spatial relationships
- Combines empirical observation with systematic organization
- Evolves through new observations and insights

By providing a coherent framework for conceptual organization, Memorativa creates an internal universe of meaning that can evolve and expand through continued interaction with the system.

## Principles of Operation

The operational principles of the Memorativa thought model include:

- **Perspectival Grounding**: Maintaining stable orientation from a centered perspective
- **Active Engagement**: Transforming passive reception into creative interaction
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Using geometric relationships to understand conceptual connections
- **Playful Exploration**: Employing game mechanics to encourage conceptual discovery
- **Symbolic Resonance**: Working with archetypal patterns to deepen understanding
- **Reflective Practice**: Creating a workshop for conscious concept formation
- **Systematic Organization**: Building coherent conceptual frameworks
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Allowing conceptual systems to grow and change over time

These principles create a continuous feedback loop between perception, concept formation, and active exploration—a cybernetic system for understanding.

## Conceptual Cosmos

The Memorativa system creates a conceptual cosmos for each user—a structured space where ideas can be explored, related, and combined. This cosmos is:

- **Centered**: Providing a stable reference point for orientation
- **Geometric**: Organizing concepts through spatial and angular relationships
- **Symbolic**: Encoding meanings through archetypal patterns
- **Dynamic**: Evolving through new inputs and interactions
- **Personal**: Uniquely shaped by individual experience and perspective
- **Universal**: Grounded in shared cognitive structures and archetypal patterns

This balanced approach maintains both the subjective nature of understanding and the objective structure needed for communication and collaboration.

## Active Understanding vs. Passive Consumption

Modern information ecosystems often promote passive consumption of disconnected content fragments. Memorativa inverts this model by:

- Transforming content consumption into active concept formation
- Creating a reflective workshop for ideas rather than a reactive stream of content
- Enabling users to situate concepts in relation to stable reference points
- Providing tools for conscious exploration rather than algorithmic manipulation
- Cultivating an internal cosmos of concepts through spatial, relational, and archetypal understanding

This approach positions the individual as an active creator of understanding rather than a passive consumer of content, using game mechanics, symbolic frameworks, and cybernetic feedback to create a system of rewards.

## Key Points

- The Memorativa model of thought is based on **Rudolf Steiner's epistemology**, which describes how concepts form through the addition of an ideal element to perceptions [1].

- **Concept formation** follows a systematic process: perception → thought stimulation → addition of ideal element → formation of concept [1].

- "Understanding" etymologically means to "**stand under**" or "stand in the midst of" concepts, reflecting the geocentric orientation at the core of the Memorativa approach [2].

- Active understanding requires four key processes: **stable orientation**, **geometric relationships**, **active navigation**, and **archetypal resonance** [3].

- Human cognitive development follows a similar pattern to the Memorativa model: physical orientation and stability precede abstract thinking and conceptual navigation [5].

- The framework enables **analogical reasoning** by providing a structured environment for discovering and exploring conceptual relationships [6].

- By enabling users to "stand at the center" of a conceptual cosmos, Memorativa transforms passive content consumption into **active concept formation** [7].

- The system's approach maintains **independence from ontological validity** of data sources while still providing useful structural relationships.

- Thought is modeled as a **dynamic interplay** between perceptions, concepts, and ideal elements, forming a systematic whole [1].

- The system emphasizes **playful engagement** with rules, symbols, and rewards to facilitate deeper conceptual understanding and active exploration.
