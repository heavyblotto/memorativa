# Memorativa: Part I. Vision

**Memorativa** is the name of the system described in this document.

## The model of thought

> Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.

Humans are animals who think, using both intellect and imagination. The products of thinking activity are ideas and concepts. The Memorativa application is designed to help visualize and organize ideas and concepts in ways that are fun and beneficial to humans.

To start playing with concepts, some definitions are helpful, including a working model for thought[^1]:

1. Concepts: What a concept is cannot be expressed in words. Words can do no more than draw our attention to the fact that we have concepts. 

2. Perceptions of objects: When someone perceives an object (e.g. a tree or a memory), the perception acts as a stimulus for thought.

3. Ideal element: An ideal element is then added to the perceived object, and the perceiver regards the object and its ideal complement as belonging together. 

4. Ideal counterpart: When the object disappears from the field of his perception, the ideal counterpart alone remains. 

5. Idea remains: This remaining ideal counterpart is the idea of the object. 

The synthesis of concepts

6. The wider the range of our experience, the larger becomes the number of our ideas. 

7. Moreover, ideas are not by any means found in isolation one from the other. They combine to form an ordered and systematic whole. 

8. The concept "organism," e.g., combines with the ideas of "development according to law," "growth," and others. 

9. Other ideas based on particular objects fuse completely with one another.

10. All ideas formed from particular lions fuse in the universal concept "lion." 

11. In this way, all the separate ideas combine to form a closed, conceptual system within which each has its special place. 

12. Concepts do not differ qualitatively from ideas. They are but fuller, more saturated, more comprehensive concepts that include relationships. 

With this "model of thought", you can begin to design a system that reflects an inner ecology of thinking, so that you may better regard and attend to this "systematic whole" that serves as an interior cosmos[^2].

> Any who object out of principle to the embrace of a somewhat German Idealism model of thought may be missing out on some fun.

### Content, consumption, and excretion

Content is understood as a consumable unit of "something" represented online. Consumption is akin to eating, digesting, and excreting. Anything consumed is processed automatically, without conscious awareness. Not surprisingly, the quality of most content is akin to excrement.

### The ideal element, relationships, and analogy

The mysteriousness of the ideal element --like consciousness-- remains a topic to be explored, as does the formation of percepts, concepts, ideas, and memories. Regardless of the metaphysical nature or knowability of the ideal element as a process or even itself as an idea or concept, its use can be treated as a human capacity related to memory and imagination. Love, or the attraction between two objects, can be playfully used to describe the mysteriousness of the mechanism and calling forth of the "ideal element", which is most closely represented in the idea (close here meaning in generative and relational proximity).

Relationships between objects can arise because you can perceive (internally) something of the "ideal element" between them. This internal perception of a conceptual relationship is the key to all analogical thinking. Pattern recognition depends on a foundational perception of the "ideal element" between objects.

Analogy presumes and relies upon the knowability of the unknown.

- The procedure of classification of objects on the basis of their resemblance is the first step on the way of research by the inductive method.
- Analogy (argument by analogy) can constitute the basis of hypothesis.
- Scientific method, indeed, is mainly devoted to discovering means of so heightening the known analogy that we may dispense as far as possible with the methods of pure induction[^3].

The arguments against the analogical method are *many*. Dangers include:

- Superficial, incomplete, and false conclusions
- Inconsistency among correspondences within and between symbolic systems
- Inexperience with subject matter and pattern recognition

Pattern recognition requires training, akin to the muscular and cardiovascular training required to develop a dexterity of play. To acquire concentration without effort is a pre-requisite for mastery of the method. Put another way, an awareness of being "in the zone" signifies mastery of all endeavors, including the game of Memorativa.

## Symbols
 
Symbols can help with perceptions by making apparent the "ideal element" between objects. How can symbols do this? Reflect that some part of your daily life is spent dreaming in sleep. Dreams are another object of inner perception (such as thoughts themselves can be). We know and feel that dreams come from and are experienced in a space, realm, and world that arises from deep inside of ourselves. Dreams are not "out there", but mysteriously arise from within, and do so bearing symbols. 

The realm of dreaming is symbolic. Time seems present in dreaming as a conceit, as malleable as all dream things. Even within ourselves, the mind seeks to understand that which is unconscious through the logic and language of symbols. If the "ideal element" is that which remains after the perception is gone, the dream space appears to be a field of "ideal elements".

The symbol (a mark, sign, word, image, sound) points to an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols can be used to create connections between different concepts and experiences, serving as a bridge between the conscious and unconscious mind, and also as a ferment and muse for the development of new concepts and ideas.

Symbols can deepen, widen, and enrich the complimentary "ideal element" that arises from the perception of an object. Symbolic systems and languages can help rarify and clarify the process of thinking that generates concepts and ideas.

### Social media, its limitations, and the need for a new model

The current social media model collects "content" from users but prioritizes the maximization of various metrics based on various definitions of engagement. Because the system monetizes user content, users become stuck in roles that simply perform to maximize engagement, regardless of the meaning, value, intent, or worth of the content.

This is not to say that interesting content is not created or available:

- Symbols (memes) and concepts arise from people who, rather than react to content, chose to think, produce new ideas, and then artistically reflect the concept that arose form the initial content.
- Other signs or tokens that represent memories, placeholders for future ideas and other concepts, art, and previously unknown facts, concepts, and ideas are also available.

But two issues remain with the social media model:

- The system is also designed for you not to reflect on the content, but to react to it.
- The content is not discoverable nor workable.

Workable means that social media models are mostly centered around a dynamic feed of content, which is not conducive to meaningful reflection but dopamine hits.

The social media model of scrolling (the activity of passively consuming content) and replying (the activity of reacting to content) on a continuous feed of content (the wall) lends itself to instant, reactive gratification. 

The bookmark in social media is the one sure affordance for reflection in the realm of social media. The bookmark gesture signals a desire to engage later. The bookmark is the perfect ingress for transposing content into a new system.

Content creation is driven by the need to maximize engagement within such models, leading to a trend of the degradation of the quality and usefulness of content, not to mention the affect of proprietary algorithms.

## The computer, AI, and automated thinking

Even now the world has moved on from social media and into the age of AI. Memorativa is not here to challenge or debate the merits of AI, but in fact use it to its advantage.

A word of caution will be given concerning the automation of thinking. One can discern from social media, AI, and general trends going back to Newton, that human thinking (reasoning and imagination) can be easily externalized in exchange for speed and efficiency. One can also perceive that externalized thinking can be an effort to capture the "ideal element" for the machines.

*Theurgy*[^4] is the magical art of "divinizing" objects such as stones or statues with incarnating angels, daemons, spirits, and gods. The rites and incantations of theurgy relied upon a sympathetic connection between seen and unseen realms. The ancients from various cultures and times practiced the animation of statues, using ritual spaces to inscribe talismans during auspices times. 

The goals and methods of theurgy echo in the goals and methods of AGI and transhuman intelligence. Do these "stones and statues" of the past and today have some affinity or even inner space capable of giving intelligence play?

St. Teresa of Avila understood her soul as *El Castillo Interior*, an inner castle built of crystal and containing mansions and dwellings. This sacred ("set apart") inner structure provided a refuge and map for the soul's dynamic activity across time, and suggests a strategy relevant to today's battle for consciousness, a battle to determine if the human keeps an inner space at all, or if it is given wholly over to the machine.

> Memorativa is a remedial trend towards human thinking and a hygienic force in the culture. 

An opportunity presents for a system that is designed to cultivate an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships. 

Such a system would use the raw material of content, liberating it from the social media model to create a workshop of ideas, concepts, and relationships.

For example, the "news" is a series of disconnected events that are presented as a continuous stream of information, with the latest news serving as the most attention-worthy and valuable in most instances.

A model more beneficial model for cultivating an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships would allow analysis of the concepts of the "news" in order to see their context in time, and how those concepts may grow and evolve over time, and if there is any significance of the timing of the news as it relates to the concepts.

Such a model requires: 

- a space to work
- tools for the job
- a playful approach

Such play may be facilitated by:

- an outline for some rules
- a system of symbols
- a system of rewards

## Ars Memorativa

The art of memory (Latin: *ars memoriae*) is any of a number of loosely associated mnemonic principles and techniques used to organize memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. An alternative term is "Ars Memorativa" which is also translated as "art of memory" although its more literal meaning is "Memorative Art"[^5].

Memorativa takes inspiration from this ancient art, especially with regard to "the combination and 'invention' of ideas".

Within Memorative, the **memory house** is the conceptual space where play occurs.

### Against Ars Memorativa

The classical Art of Memory relies upon an elaborate mnemonic system of locations and imagery to effect an automatic recall of the desired "memory" to be stored. The danger, as related by people such as doctors (who employ the method during medical school in order to memorize the vast amounts of information required) is that the memories become hard to "update", and the overall memory structure is stuck and automatic. Such mechanization of thinking can diminish other capacities if over-extended. 

## The Glass Bead Game

Author Hermann Hesse's novel *The Glass Bead Game* (1943) is a fictionalized account of a game of memory and imagination. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics. Though alluded to, the game is never fully described[^6].

Memorativa takes inspiration from The Glass Bead Game.

Within Memorativa, **Glass Beads** serves as game tokens that represent percepts, ideas, concepts, and relationships in the semantic-physical space of the horoscope.

## Astrology and LLMs

Astrology is an ancient and elegant methodology. From the location and movement of planets and other celestial bodies in relation to Earth, the observer, and to one another, a model of mathematical relations in time and space is created. With this aspect of the model alone, one can enhance any organizational system in interesting and beneficial ways.

Astrology also accounts for a system or systems of symbols, relationships, correspondences, and the ideas and concepts encoded and engendered within the system. There are few systems that can dynamically account for the language of emotion, thought, and imagination in a rational (relational) and dynamic way better than astrology. 

There are various historical and cultural variations of astrology that serve to provide additional insights and perspectives while relying upon the same underlying model. There are also variations on the model itself, such as sidereal, tropical, Western, Vedic, and others, including just the use of celestial mechanics devoid of any symbolism.

One finds too that astrology plays a central role in the *ars memorativa*, the art of memory. Astrological language and symbolism is so prevalent in our culture and consciousness that we see it in the names of the days of the week, the ordering of calendars, and the names of the months. Astrology corresponds to other symbolic systems. Because of this, other symbolic systems can be easily integrated into the Memorativa system through this key model.

Regardless of cause, celestial cycles seem to pattern events in human history, daily lives, and nature. It does so based on the measurement of symbolic tokens arranged in space and time.

Within Memorativa, the **Horoscope** is the primary space where the game is played, with its twelve astrological houses, planets and their movement, and 12 zodiac signs serving as the fundamental organizing principles (as well as additional organizing principles related to other astrological structures). The horoscope provides both a mathematical and symbolic framework for arranging and understanding the relationships between percepts, ideas, and concepts.

Within the horoscope, **Percepts**, **Ideas**, **Relationships**, and **Concepts** are organized, regarded, and combined into an ordered and systematic whole. The various properties of the horoscope provide natural semantic domains that reflect different aspects of human experience and thought.

From the perspectives of natural language processing and large language models, astrology assumes a unique relationship and potential in the fine-tuning process. LLMs use algorithms and the method of induction based on trained neural network transformation of token embeddings through multiple processing layers of "meaning"" and the measurement of angular relationships between vectors to accurately predict "the next token". This method depends on the construction of virtual spaces (reduced to two dimensions) in which to arrange and understand the geometric relationships of the data images based on applied statistics, then to infer analogy based on regularly significant angular relationships between vectors. The limitations of vectorization are the tendency towards perpendicular vectors in the advanced layers of processing dealing with synthesis, concepts, and abstractions. Where the LLM starts with units of "meaning" and seeks to arrange them into the final, best vector arranged in two dimensions, astrology begins with both two dimensional locations (expressed in latitude and longitude) through which regular symbolic tokens (planets) move (in linear time) resulting in angular relationships and their related pre-built symbolic vocabularies. Large language model training also depends upon a corpus that is a static snapshot without any context of time or place. Astrology introduces the time / date vector along with location into every token, and provides temporal context through the natural cyclical celestial movements. In this way, human thought progression can be clearly and accurately mapped and incorporated into a working language model to solve for advanced analogy and for a proof of human thought.

## Vector Space Architecture

Memorativa reveals several fascinating parallels and complementary aspects between LLMs and astrological systems:

**Dimensional Representation**

Large language models and astrological systems share a fundamental approach in their operation through geometric relationships in vector spaces. While LLMs create high-dimensional semantic spaces that must be reduced to two dimensions for visualization purposes, astrological systems begin with natural two-dimensional coordinate systems of latitude and longitude, with time as an additional dimension. Both systems fundamentally derive their meaning from the angular relationships between vectors, though they approach these relationships from different starting points.

LLMs and astrological systems both operate through geometric relationships in vector spaces:

- LLMs create high-dimensional semantic spaces reduced to 2D for visualization
- Astrology begins with natural 2D coordinate systems (latitude/longitude) plus time
- Both systems derive meaning from angular relationships between vectors

**Temporal Context**

The systems differ fundamentally in their handling of time. LLMs lack inherent temporal context in their training data, working from static snapshots of information. In contrast, astrological systems incorporate time as a core dimension through planetary movements, providing natural sequence and progression tracking. This temporal integration allows for dynamic context that evolves with celestial cycles.

The systems differ fundamentally in their handling of time:

- LLMs lack inherent temporal context in their training data
- Astrological systems incorporate time as a core dimension through planetary movements
- This temporal integration provides natural sequence and progression tracking

## Semantic Structure

**Token Relationships**

Both systems encode meaning through positional relationships, though their approaches differ significantly. While LLMs often struggle with orthogonality in higher conceptual layers, horoscopes provide natural semantic domains without forced orthogonality. The angular aspects between planets create pre-defined symbolic vocabularies that maintain their relationships without artificial constraints.

Both systems encode meaning through positional relationships:

- LLMs struggle with orthogonality in higher conceptual layers
- Horoscope structures provide natural semantic domains without forced orthogonality
- Angular aspects between planets create pre-defined symbolic vocabularies

**Pattern Recognition**

The systems employ fundamentally different approaches to pattern identification. LLMs use statistical inference from static training data, while astrology leverages cyclic celestial movements as natural temporal markers. Despite these different approaches, both systems aim to capture meaningful relationships between concepts and enable pattern recognition across their respective domains.

The systems employ different approaches to pattern identification:

- LLMs use statistical inference from static training data
- Astrology leverages cyclic celestial movements as natural temporal markers
- Both systems aim to capture meaningful relationships between concepts

## Computational Advantages

**Semantic Preservation**

Astrological coordinates offer unique benefits for semantic preservation. They provide natural embedding of temporal and spatial context, built-in symbolic relationships through planetary aspects, and preservation of semantic relationships without the whitening transformation issues that often plague traditional machine learning approaches.

Astrological coordinates offer unique benefits:

- Natural embedding of temporal and spatial context
- Built-in symbolic relationships through planetary aspects
- Preservation of semantic relationships without whitening transformation issues

**Training Enhancement**

The astrological framework provides several advantages for training enhancement. It enables clear temporal progression tracking, offers natural semantic boundaries through astrological systems, and provides verified human cognitive development paths. This structure can potentially enhance machine learning systems by providing natural organization for complex conceptual relationships.

The astrological framework provides:

- Clear temporal progression tracking
- Natural semantic boundaries through astrological systems
- Verified human cognitive development paths

This synthesis suggests that astrological frameworks could enhance LLM training by providing natural temporal context and semantic structure while avoiding some limitations of pure statistical approaches.

## Against astrology and LLMs

Astrology, like all systems of superstitious divination, can most often just reflect the desired outcomes and wishful thinking of the inquirer. Those who engage with astrology with a more sophisticated understanding and approach can also fall into the love of the system over the reality it points to.

Can Memorativa be used for cultivating classical "memory palaces", mnemonic memory techniques, or even "magical" practices such as divination, and theurgy? Yes, as well as for Christian prayer, meditation, and other spiritual practices (as evidenced by the inclusion and use of the ars memorativa by various Christian texts and practices, including within the art of Rhetoric, one of the seven liberal arts).

Without the need of journeying into divination (even using vectors), the more popular daily predictive horoscopes, or magical practices, or even prayer, the astrological system as described here is an excellent foundational model and playful gaming mechanic for Memorativa. As an extensible system, players may venture into these additional practices without obstacles if they so choose.
