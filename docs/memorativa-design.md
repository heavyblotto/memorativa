# Memorativa

**Memorativa** is the name of the system described in this document.

Rather than only model and represent the physical properties of objects, the Memorativa system seeks to model and represent the conceptual properties of perceptions. The model can be defined as:

- input goes into the system to create the percept
- the system calculates an encapsulating concept that can by represented by three conceptual vectors

## Percept-triplet

In the Memorativa model, human perception can be conceptually categorized according to three conceptual vectors, called the **percept-triplet**:

- **What**: the archetype - *the archetype vector*
- **How**: the form of expression of the archetype - *the expression vector*
- **Where**: the form of expression of the archetype in the conceptual field of activity - *the mundane vector*

Percept-triplets can be applied to humans, things, and events to calculate encapsulating concepts. Keywords can be used as identifiers to analogically correlate percepts to a data dictionary of concepts.

Western mythology and symbology provide prototypes that are encoded into the English language and culture (which is of concern to large language models and other semantic processors) and that can serve as the "data dictionary" for percept encoding.

## Percept-triplet vector 1: archetype

The **archetype vector** is defined as:

- Outside the bounds of conceptualization
- An active force and dynamic principle
- Something that can be represented by prototypes
- A conceptual goal and a kind of center of conceptual gravity for prototypes
- Universal and consistent 

Memorativa uses archetypes as the "what" vector, and specifically Western prototypes of archetypes. In Memorativa, prototypes act as the representation of the input enjoined with a concept. The more closely a prototype "gravitates" towards the conceptual field of the archetype, the more clearly the prototype expresses the encapsulating concept of the percept.

**Planets**, with their centers of gravity and symbolic potency, provide the core prototypes for the archetypal "what" vector of the percept-triplets.

These are prototypical classical Planets of Western mythology, with some conceptual correlations:

- **Sun ☉**: Identity, vitality, consciousness, purpose
- **Moon ☽**: Emotions, instincts, nurturing, cycles
- **Mercury ☿**: Communication, learning, analysis, connection
- **Venus ♀**: Values, relationships, harmony, attraction
- **Mars ♂**: Action, drive, assertion, energy
- **Jupiter ♃**: Expansion, wisdom, growth, opportunity
- **Saturn ♄**: Structure, limitation, responsibility, time

These are the prototypical modern Planets, with some conceptual correlations:

- **Uranus ♅**: Innovation, freedom, disruption, awakening
- **Neptune ♆**: Spirituality, dissolution, imagination, unity
- **Pluto ♇**: Transformation, power, depth, regeneration

Each of these conceptual correlations are multivariate depending on if the reference is something personal, mundane, or itself conceptual. Thus "Sun" can be used to conceptually categorize people, events, or things.

Each of these conceptual correlations (and all correlations in the percept-triplet) have a certain cosmological orientation, that is, of an object in time and space on Earth.

## Percept-triplet vector 2: expression

The **expression vector** represents the form and expression of the archetype (the "How" vector) and is defined by:

- One of twelve symbols that modify the Planet archetypal force
- A representation of style, tone, and modality for the archetype
- The expression and manifestation of the archetype
- Determines how force is channeled

In keeping with an analogous structure to represent the different kinds of modalities and expressions of a Planet, the Western mythological classification of the constellations demarcating the ecliptic, the **Zodiac Signs**, serve as the twelve primary symbols of the "How" vector. According to the established mythology, each Zodiacal Sign has a "ruling" Planet that encodes a further vector of conceptual significance. In the case of the conceptual correlations for Signs, the vector particularly relates to the observer's understanding of the nature of the percept as an expression of the archetype.

Signs provide many additional correlated conceptual vectors, such as body parts, plants and minerals, month of the year, ruling Planet, etc.

## Percept-triplet vector 3: mundane

The **mundane vector** (the "Where") is the area of reality where the archetypal form of expression manifests, and is defined by:

- One of 12 areas called Houses
- The operational zone of activity for the percept
- Correlations to cycles, times, phases, and durations of human observed events
- Grounds symbolism in tangible reality, reflecting where energies manifest most visibly

Houses are categorized in Western astrology as follows:

| **House**                                |  **Area**                 |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|  **1st, The Ascendant**                  |  Identity                 |
|  **2nd, The House of Value**             |  Resources                |
|  **3rd, The House of Communication**     |  Learning                 |
|  **4th, The Nadir/IC**                   |  Home                     |
|  **5th, The House of Pleasure**          |  Creativity               |
|  **6th, The House of Service**           |  Routine                  |

|  **8th, The House of Transformation**    |  Shared resources         |
|  **9th, The House of Philosophy**        |  Beliefs                  |
|  **10th, The Midheaven/MC**              |  Authority                |
|  **11th, The House of Friendship**       |  Groups                   |
|  **12th, The House of the Unconscious**  |  Hidden matters           |

## Example encoding of a percept to concept using the percept-triplet method

In this example, the Memorativa percept-triplet method is used to conceptualize an input. The output is a Planet expressed in a Sign manifested in a House.

Define an **input** as:

- **URL**
- **Title**
- **Description**

For example:

- **URL**: link to a photo of an apple
- **Title**: "Eve's temptation"
- **Description**: "The apple in mythology"

Here the input is not simply an object (the apple), but a perception of the object conditioned by the observer's state and context, as reflected in the title an description.

The input—an image of an apple titled *"Eve's Temptation"* with the description *"The apple in mythology"*—can be mapped to the triplet vectors (planet-sign-house) by decoding its mythological and symbolic layers (such decoding / encoding can be accomplished using current LLM models without additional training). Below is a triplet classification informed by historical, cultural, and esoteric correspondences:

### 1. Archetype vector: Venus/Pluto

The apple’s mythological ties to **temptation** and **desire** align with:

- **Venus**: Ruler of love, beauty, and relational harmony. Apples are linked to Venus in Libra, symbolizing romantic allure and the tension between ethics (Libra’s balance) and indulgence.  
- **Pluto**: Represents taboo, transformation, and shadow work. The forbidden fruit narrative (Eve’s defiance) mirrors Pluto’s themes of confronting hidden truths and societal taboos.  
- **Ambiguity**: Venus emphasizes attraction, while Pluto underscores rebellion. The classification depends on whether the focus is on *desire* (Venus) or *transgression* (Pluto).  

### 2. Expression vector: Libra/Scorpio

The title and mythological context filter through two signs:

- **Libra**: Governed by Venus, Libra embodies choice, partnership, and moral dilemmas. The apple’s role in adjudicating “the fairest goddess” (Paris’ judgment) reflects Libra’s arbitration themes.  
- **Scorpio**: Ruled by Pluto/ Mars, Scorpio symbolizes secrets, sexuality, and rebirth. The serpent in Eden (often linked to Scorpio) recontextualizes the apple as a catalyst for awakening primal knowledge.  

**Key Contrast**: Libra frames the apple as a *relational catalyst*, while Scorpio interprets it as a *subversive force*.  

### 3. Mundane vector: 7th/8th/9th House

The apple’s mythological roles anchor it to three life domains: 

1. **7th House (Relationships)**: Represents partnerships, contracts, and “the other.” Eve’s act of sharing the apple with Adam mirrors 7th-house dynamics of mutual influence and moral negotiation.  
2. **8th House (Taboo/Transformation)**: Governs shared resources, secrets, and rebirth. The apple’s forbidden status and its link to mortality (Genesis 3:19) align with 8th-house themes.  
3. **9th House (Beliefs/Knowledge)**: Connects to philosophy, dogma, and higher learning. The Tree of Knowledge myth positions the apple as a symbol of intellectual/spiritual awakening.  

**Dominant House**: The 9th house best captures the apple’s role in *challenging dogma* (Eve’s defiance of divine law) and seeking gnosis.  

### **Synthesis & Interpretation**  

| **Vector**      | **Classification**                | **Rationale**                                                                 |  
|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Planet**       | Venus (primary), Pluto (secondary) | Love magic vs. transformative sin                               |  
| **Sign**         | Libra (primary), Scorpio (shadow) | Balance vs. subversion; Venusian allure vs. Plutonian taboo       |  
| **House**        | 9th House (knowledge/rebirth)     | Mythological focus on *questioning authority* and pursuing wisdom    |  

### Challenges & Refinements

- **Ambiguity**: The apple’s dual Venus/Pluto associations require contextual prioritization. A “temptation” title leans Pluto, while “mythology” broadens to Venus-Libra.  
- **Cultural Bias**: Western art’s apple-as-sin motif (post-Latin mistranslation) risks overshadowing older links to Aphrodite (love) or Idunn’s youth-giving apples.  
- **House Overlap**: The 9th house’s philosophical focus may conflate with the 8th’s taboo; user context (e.g., emphasis on rebellion vs. wisdom) clarifies weighting.  

## Second example encoding of a percept to concept using the percept-triplet method








## Conceptual time

Percept-triplets do not require a time vector to successfully encode a percept into a concept, but a time vector can be added to the percept-triplet to represent conceptual time states:

- **Mundane state**: a past or future timestamp that relates to the concept, such as the time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept, or an imagined future date related to an imagined future event
- **Quantum state**: a conceptual state of indeterminate or no time, or immeasurable present time
- **Holographic state**: a conceptual time state associated with a percept that is attuned to a reference time
