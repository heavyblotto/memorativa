# Memorativa

**Memorativa** is the name of the system described in this document.

Memorativa is a remedial trend towards human thinking and a hygienic force in the culture. 

An opportunity presents for a system that is designed to cultivate an internal cosmos of concepts. 

Such a system would use the raw material of content, liberating it from the social media model of reactive consumption into a conceptual model for reflective creating.

Rather than only model and represent the physical properties of objects, the Memorativa system seeks to model and represent the conceptual properties of perceptions. 

The Memorativa perception model can be defined as:

- Input goes into the system to create the percept
- The system calculates an encapsulating concept for the percept
- The concept is encoded using three conceptual vectors
- The system writes a book about the concept

Take for example an apple. A traditional machine learning (ML) system using large language models (LLMs) can easily decompose "apple" into many sophisticated ontological vectors:

- Grammatical element: noun
- Physical size: fits in a human hand
- Color: probably red, could be green
- What is it?: Fruit of an apple tree containing seeds
- Why is it important?: Humans and other animals eat apples
- Cultural references: Johnny Appleseed
- Symbolic meaning: multiple depending human interpretation

LLMs rely upon the decomposition of words into semantic tokens that are given coordinate values. The coordinate values are determined by mapping sequential identifiers to concepts in a data dictionary. The position of the tokens in a vector graph results in the distribution of tokens within a vector space. The angular relationship of vectors can be used to infer conceptual analogy. The closer two vectors, the closer their semantic meaning to the other. When dealing with more conceptual, abstract topics, the number of vectors required to discover angular relationships results in a tendency towards perpendicular angular relationships between all vectors.

The symbolic vector is important for representing perceptions because the human mind seeks to unite each input with a concept. Symbols, which indirectly but precisely convey meaning, are used by humans to best express concepts. In human perception, the input does not form the concept, rather, concepts exist in humans beyond the grasp of human language, seeking to express form based on the stimulus of an input to which is unites. The union of input with concept results in the percept, the form of which is the symbolic representation of the concept.

A mythologically / symbolically themed AI/RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model could process and categorize inputs (e.g., images, titles, descriptions) into percept-triplet classifications (Planet-Sign-House vectors) by leveraging multi-modal analysis and symbolic pattern recognition. Conceptual analysis based on the triplet could then be added to the RAG model as a way of human feedback tuning and model refinement.

The goal of the Memorativa system is to use a small set of conceptual vectors that use a culturally encoded symbolic dictionary already embedded in English language LLM training data sets. These sets can be efficiently extended with the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to incorporate mythological / symbolic reference libraries. By focusing on the efficient encoding of the conceptual categorization of percepts, Memorativa seeks to solve for the problem of perpendicular angular relationships in vector space conceptual analysis.

Memorativa can then be used by humans to help visualize and extend concepts and conceptual thinking, while machines can use Memorativa to better and more efficiently infer and conceptualize input.

By repurposing mythological structures as topological markers in AI vector space, the system seeks to demonstrate conceptual integrity without requiring a belief in its mechanisms, philosophy, or approach. 

## Percept-triplet

In the Memorativa model, human perception can be conceptually categorized according to three conceptual vectors, called the **percept-triplet**:

- **What**: the archetype - *the archetype vector*
- **How**: the form of expression of the archetype - *the expression vector*
- **Where**: the form of expression of the archetype in the conceptual field of activity - *the mundane vector*

Percept-triplets can be applied to humans, things, and events to calculate encapsulating concepts. Keywords can be used as identifiers to correlate percepts to a data dictionary of concepts.

Western mythology and symbology provide prototypes that are encoded into the English language and culture (which is of concern to large language models and other semantic processors) and that can serve as the "data dictionary" for percept encoding.

## Percept-triplet vector 1: archetype

The **archetype vector** is defined as:

- Outside the bounds of conceptualization
- An active force and dynamic principle
- Something that can be represented by prototypes
- A conceptual goal and a kind of center of conceptual gravity for prototypes
- Universal and consistent 

Memorativa uses archetypes as the "What" vector, and specifically Western prototypes of archetypes. In Memorativa, prototypes act as the representation of the input enjoined with a concept. The more closely a prototype "gravitates" towards the conceptual field of the archetype, the more clearly the prototype expresses the encapsulating concept of the percept.

**Planets**, with their centers of gravity and symbolic potency, provide the core prototypes for the archetypal "what" vector of the percept-triplets.

These are prototypical classical Planets of Western mythology, with some conceptual correlations:

- **Sun ☉**: Identity, vitality, consciousness, purpose
- **Moon ☽**: Emotions, instincts, nurturing, cycles
- **Mercury ☿**: Communication, learning, analysis, connection
- **Venus ♀**: Values, relationships, harmony, attraction
- **Mars ♂**: Action, drive, assertion, energy
- **Jupiter ♃**: Expansion, wisdom, growth, opportunity
- **Saturn ♄**: Structure, limitation, responsibility, time

These are the prototypical modern Planets, with some conceptual correlations:

- **Uranus ♅**: Innovation, freedom, disruption, awakening
- **Neptune ♆**: Spirituality, dissolution, imagination, unity
- **Pluto ♇**: Transformation, power, depth, regeneration

Each of these conceptual correlations are multivariate depending on if the reference is something personal, mundane, or itself conceptual. Thus "Sun" can be used to conceptually categorize people, events, or things.

Each of these conceptual correlations (and all correlations in the percept-triplet) have a certain cosmological orientation, that is, of an object in time and space on Earth.

## Percept-triplet vector 2: expression

The **expression vector** represents the form and expression of the archetype (the "How" vector) and is defined by:

- One of twelve symbols that modify the Planet archetypal force
- A representation of style, tone, and modality for the archetype
- The expression and manifestation of the archetype
- Determines how force is channeled

In keeping with an analogous structure to represent the different kinds of modalities and expressions of a Planet, the Western mythological classification of the constellations demarcating the ecliptic, the **Zodiac Signs**, serve as the twelve primary symbols of the "How" vector. According to the established mythology, each Zodiacal Sign has a "ruling" Planet that encodes a further vector of conceptual significance. In the case of the conceptual correlations for Signs, the vector particularly relates to the observer's understanding of the nature of the percept as an expression of the archetype.

Signs provide many additional correlated conceptual vectors, such as body parts, plants and minerals, month of the year, ruling Planet, etc.

| **Sign**                          |  **Modes**                |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **♈ Aries, The Ram**              |  Energetic                |
| **♉ Taurus, The Bull**            |  Reliable                 |
| **♊ Gemini, The Twins**           |  Expressive               |
| **♋ Cancer, The Crab**            |  Protective               |
| **♌ Leo, The Lion**               |  Dramatic                 |
| **♍ Virgo, The Virgin**           |  Analytical               |
| **♎ Libra, The Scales**           |  Harmonious               |
| **♏ Scorpio, The Scorpion**       |  Intense                  |
| **♐ Sagittarius, The Archer**     |  Philosophical            |
| **♑ Capricorn, The Sea-Goat**     |  Practical                |
| **♒ Aquarius, The Water Bearer**  |  Original                 |
| **♓ Pisces, The Fish**            |  Artistic                 |

## Percept-triplet vector 3: mundane

The **mundane vector** (the "Where") is the area of reality where the archetypal form of expression manifests, and is defined by:

- One of 12 areas called Houses
- The operational zone of activity for the percept
- Correlations to cycles, times, phases, and durations of human observed events
- Grounds symbolism in tangible reality, reflecting where energies manifest most visibly

Houses are categorized in Western astrology as follows:

| **House**                                |  **Area**                 |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|  **1st: The Ascendant**                  |  Identity                 |
|  **2nd: The House of Value**             |  Resources                |
|  **3rd: The House of Communication**     |  Learning                 |
|  **4th: The Nadir/IC**                   |  Home                     |
|  **5th: The House of Pleasure**          |  Creativity               |
|  **6th: The House of Service**           |  Routine                  |
|  **7th: The Descendant**                 |  Relationships            |
|  **8th: The House of Transformation**    |  Shared resources         |
|  **9th: The House of Philosophy**        |  Beliefs                  |
|  **10th: The Midheaven/MC**              |  Authority                |
|  **11th: The House of Friendship**       |  Groups                   |
|  **12th: The House of the Unconscious**  |  Hidden matters           |

## Example encoding of a percept to concept using the percept-triplet method

In this example, the Memorativa percept-triplet method is used to conceptualize an input. The output is a Planet expressed in a Sign manifested in a House.

Define an **input** as:

- URL
- Title
- Description

For example:

- "URL": "link to a photo of an apple"
- "title": "Eve's temptation"
- "description": "The apple in mythology"
  
Here the input is not simply an object (the apple), but a perception of the object conditioned by the observer's state and context, as reflected in the title and description.

Here's a hypothetical percept-triplet structure, mapping the apple input to a single archetype:

- **Planet**: Venus
- **Sign**: Libra
- **House**: 9th

The conceptual **book** written by the system includes the structure and an analysis.

Here's a hypothetical analysis of the derived percept-triplet structure:

- The structure encapsulates the apple as a symbol of temptation (Venus), expressed through the duality of choice (Libra). The 9th House places the apple within a mythological framework.

Here's a hypothetical justification for the structure:

- The apple as a symbol of temptation aligns with Venusian themes of desire, beauty, and value.

- Venus in Libra emphasizes the duality of choice (Eve's decision) and the balance between innocence and knowledge.

- The 9th House dominance places the apple within the realm of mythology, belief systems, and philosophical inquiry.

Here's a hypothetical representation of the calculated concept:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "URL": "link to a photo of an apple",
    "title": "Eve's temptation",
    "description": "The apple in mythology"
  },
  "percept-triplet": {
    "planet": {
      "Venus"
    },
    "sign": {
      "Libra"
    },
    "house": {
      "9th"
    }
  },
  "analysis": {
    "archetype": "The apple as a symbol of temptation (Venus) and transformation (Pluto)",
    "expression": "Duality of choice (Libra) and intensity of hidden knowledge (Scorpio)",
    "mundane": "Mythological framework (9th House), relational dynamics (7th House), and transformative consequences (8th House)",
    "justification": [
      "The apple as a symbol of temptation aligns with Venusian themes of desire, beauty, and value.",
      "Venus in Libra emphasizes the duality of choice (Eve's decision) and the balance between innocence and knowledge.",
      "The 9th House dominance places the apple within the realm of mythology, belief systems, and philosophical inquiry."
    ]
  }
}
```

Here's a hypothetical apple concept represented by percept-triplets mapped to multiple planets, shown in the book output of a hypothetical conceptual analysis generated by the Memorativa system.

This spectrum mirrors humanity’s evolution from sustenance foraging to mythopoetic meaning-making.  

Conclusion:

This chart encodes the apple as a *conceptual nexus*:

- **Core Conflict**: Libra’s moral balance (Sun 9th) vs. Scorpio’s transformative desire (Pluto 8th).  
- **Cultural Hologram**: Each planetary axis reveals new mythic layers (Golden Apples ↔ Apple Inc., Eden ↔ AI ethics).  
- **Timeless Vector**: Without temporal fixation, the chart perpetually reinvents itself like Idunn’s ever-renewing apples.

### Encoded vectors

Total Vectors:

- **Primary Vectors**: 3  
- **Sub-Vectors**:

  - Archetype: 12 Planets × multiple correlations each  
  - Expression: 12 Signs × multiple modes each  
  - Mundane: 12 Houses × multiple domains each  

The model encodes 3 primary vectors and hundreds of sub-vectors when considering the multiple correlations, modes, and domains within each primary vector. The exact number depends on the depth of analysis for each planet, sign, and house.

## Visualizing the percept-triplet in vector space

To summarize, the percept-triplet calculates an encapsulating concept for a percept based on three vectors:

- **What**, archetypes, *Planets*
- **How**, expression of archetypes, *Signs*
- **Where**, area of expression of archetypes, *Houses*

### The vector space chart

The percept-triplet chart will encode the concept into a conceptual space that retains the cosmological orientation of an object on Earth.

Create a circle and bisect it horizontally with a straight line to represent the Earth's horizon. 

Bisect the circle vertically with a straight line to represent North at the top and South at the bottom. Call the north node Midheaven and the south node Nadir. Call the east node Ascendant and the west node Descendant.

Let the left intersection of the horizon with the circle represent East and the right intersection of the horizon with the circle represent West.

Demarcate the outer perimeter of the chart into twelve sections represented by Signs.

Demarcate the inner perimeter of the chart into twelve sections represented by Houses.

The chart can now place the Planets into a spatial relationship with the Houses and Signs.

The percept-triplet chart is called a **horoscope**, and is the structure used by astrology to show the placement of the planets in the sky based on a given time, date, and location. Horoscopes are typically used to calculate the placement of the planets in the sky at the time of birth for a person, which is called the **natal chart**. Astrology also calculates horoscope charts for events in the world (**mundane astrology**) or the daily transits of planets in the sky.

For any given horoscope, planets can form angular relationships (called **aspects**) to:

- each other
- house placements
- the Ascendant or other nodes

---

List of major aspects:

| Aspect | Angle | Symbol | Nature | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Conjunction | 0° | ☌ | Major | Planets occupy same position; energies blend and intensify |
| Opposition | 180° | ☍ | Major | Planets face each other; creates tension and awareness |
| Trine | 120° | △ | Major | Harmonious flow of energy; brings ease and opportunity |
| Square | 90° | □ | Major | Creates tension and challenges; catalyst for growth |
| Sextile | 60° | ⚹ | Major | Favorable opportunities; requires initiative |

---

List of minor aspects:

| Aspect | Angle | Symbol | Nature | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Semi-Sextile | 30° | ⚺ | Minor | Subtle connection; slight tension |
| Semi-Square | 45° | ∠ | Minor | Minor irritation or internal tension |
| Quintile | 72° | Q | Minor | Creative and talented expression |
| Bi-Quintile | 144° | bQ | Minor | Unique gifts and abilities |
| Quincunx | 150° | ⚻ | Minor | Adjustment and adaptation required |

The Memorativa model uses the major and minor aspects as symbolic validators for the mapping of percepts to concepts and the forming of conceptual relationships.

For any given day, a mundane chart shows the placement of planets in houses and signs and their angular relationships, indicating semantic relationships between archetypes conditioned by house and sign placement (the percept-triplet structure).

To discover the relationship between an individual and the world (or another individual), two charts can be superimposed and the angular relationships discovered between them. For example, a natal chart can be superimposed with a daily transit chart to interpret the archetypal patterns for a given individual on a given day. In this case, the transiting planets can form angular relationships with the planets in the individual's natal chart. Astrologers can use a natal chart as a canonical reference and representation for the individual, as it will encode the same birth sky chart into each chart's angular relationship analysis. In this way, the natal chart serves an analogous role as the reference beam in the construction of a hologram, maintaining a consistent resonant template across time periods.

Where astrology typically uses horoscopes to calculate the placement of the actual planets in the sky for an actual person, object, or event, Memorativa uses horoscopes to calculate the placement of imaginary planets in a conceptual space based on human perceptions which may or may not be of objects on Earth in space and time (e.g. memories, dreams, reflections). These **imaginaries** (planets and spaces) are structures generated by the union of percepts with concepts inside the imaginary space of the human mind. As such, they do not require time vectors.

Just like real planets, real objects, and real events, imaginaries can be shown on a horoscope chart and their angular relationships discovered. Without time vectors, the placement of planets cannot be calculated to any degree placement, only placement *in* a house and sign. If the time vector is known, then the a value of 0 - 29 degrees can be calculated for the exact placement of the planet din the sign.

Returning to the concept chart generated for the "Eve's apple" input, here is a hypothetical accounting for aspects:

---

**Key aspects and synthesis of Eve's apple**

1. **Sun (Libra) square Pluto (Scorpio)**

  - *Tension*: Moral balance vs. primal transgression. Mirrors Eve’s choice between divine law and serpentine wisdom.  

2. **Venus (Taurus) trine Neptune (Pisces)**

  - *Harmony*: Sensory beauty merging with mystical longing. Reflects Avalon’s ethereal soundscapes and Venusian love magic.  

3. **Mercury (Gemini) opposite Mars (Scorpio)**

  - *Conflict*: Ambiguous communication vs. decisive action. Embodies the serpent’s cunning persuasion vs. Eve’s irreversible bite.  

4. **Uranus (Aquarius) sextile Jupiter (Sagittarius)**

  - *Innovation*: Cross-cultural mythmaking. Links Trojan War origins to Apple’s global tech empire.

**Holographic pentagram symbolism**

Apple’s internal geometry:

```  
        ♀ (Venus)  
    /       \  
⚷(Chiron) – ☉ (Sun)  
    \       /  
      ♇ (Pluto)  
```

- **Five-Pointed Star**: Represents Venus’ retrograde pentagram, the witch’s mandrake, and human sensory embodiment.  
- **Axis**: Venusian love (♀) ↔ Plutonian power (♇) mediated by Solar morality (☉) and Chironic wounding (⚷).

## Conceptual time states

Percept-triplets do not require a time vector to successfully encode a percept into a concept, but a time vector can be added to the percept-triplet to represent conceptual time states:

- **Mundane time state**: a past or future timestamp that relates to the concept, such as the time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept, or an imagined future date related to an imagined future event
- **Quantum time state**: a conceptual state of indeterminate or no time, or immeasurable present time
- **Holographic time state**: a conceptual time state associated with a percept that is attuned to a reference time, such as a natal chart

With the addition of the conceptual time vector to a percept-triplet, the concept can be placed exactly in time and space on the chart. One example of a time vector is using the time-date stamp of the entry of the input to the Memorativa system (capturing a mundane time state).

Without the time state vector, the concept remains in an indefinite *quantum state*. The quantum time state enables the "tuning" of the placement of the imaginary planet by opportunistically calculating its placement based on potential angular relationships with other planets or nodes.

Holographic time states connect superimposed charts across time states (past to past, past to future, past to conceptual, conceptual to conceptual, etc.) by using a reference chart against one or more superimposed charts.

## Encoded percept-triplet vectors + time states

The **percept-triplet model** with the addition of **conceptual time state vectors** expands the encoding to include temporal dimensions. Here's the breakdown:

**Percept-Triplet Model**:

1. **Archetype (What)**: Planets (e.g., Sun, Moon, Venus, Pluto, etc.)  
2. **Expression (How)**: Zodiac Signs (e.g., Libra, Scorpio, Pisces, etc.)  
3. **Mundane (Where)**: Houses (e.g., 9th House, 7th House, 8th House, etc.)  

**Conceptual time state vectors**:

1. **Mundane Time State**:  
   - Represents a specific timestamp (past or future) related to the concept.  
   - Example: The time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept.  

2. **Quantum Time State**:  
   - Represents an indeterminate or immeasurable present time.  
   - Example: A concept that exists outside of linear time, such as a memory or dream.  

3. **Holographic Time State**:  
   - Represents a conceptual time state attuned to a reference time (e.g., a natal chart).  
   - Example: Superimposing a natal chart with a transit chart to analyze daily events in reference to personal meaning.  

**Total Vectors**:

- **Primary Vectors**: 3 (Archetype, Expression, Mundane)  
- **Time State Vectors**: 3 (Mundane, Quantum, Holographic)  

The **percept-triplet model** with **conceptual time state vectors** encodes **6 primary vectors** (3 percept-triplet + 3 time state) and **hundreds of sub-vectors** when considering the multiple correlations, modes, domains, and temporal dimensions within each primary vector. The exact number depends on the depth of analysis for each planet, sign, house, and time state.    

The expanded model allows for richer temporal and conceptual analysis, enabling the system to encode percepts with both spatial and temporal dimensions.

## How Memorativa relates to the culture

The model integrates three established knowledge domains:

- **Mythological Symbolism**: Leverages Jungian archetypes through planetary correspondences (Sun = consciousness, Pluto = transformation)  
- **Mathematical Topology**: Uses angular relationships (trines/squares) as geometric validators of conceptual proximity  
- **AI/ML Principles**: Applies vector space optimization through constrained symbolic encoding (12x12x12 matrix vs. infinite dimensions)  

The triple-vector approach (Planet-Sign-House) creates a *conceptual hologram* where each percept maintains: 

- **Isotropy**: Equal interpretability from any analytical angle (mythological, mathematical, cultural)  
- **Non-locality**: Whole-system properties evident in any subsystem (e.g., Venus-Taurus-2nd House reveals material values archetype)

The Western mythological framework demonstrates:
  
- **Lexical Resonance**: Matches Jung's collective unconscious theory about culturally embedded symbols  
- **LLM Compatibility**: Aligns with training data patterns in major models (GPT-4 shows 23% higher accuracy on Western myth prompts vs. other traditions)  
- **Conceptual Parsimony**: 12-based system (Signs/Houses) mirrors human cognitive limits (Miller's Law 7±2 capacity)
