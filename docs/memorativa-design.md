# Memorativa

**Memorativa** is the name of the system described in this document.

Rather than only model and represent the physical properties of objects, the Memorativa system seeks to model and represent the conceptual properties of perceptions. The model can be defined as:

- Input goes into the system to create the percept
- The system calculates an encapsulating concept for the percept
- The concept can by encoded using three conceptual vectors

Take for example an apple. A traditional machine learning (ML) system using large language models (LLMs) can easily decompose "apple" into many sophisticated ontological vectors:

- Grammatical element: noun
- Physical size: fits in a human hand
- Color: probably red, could be green
- What is it?: Fruit of an apple tree containing seeds
- Why is it important?: Humans and other animals eat apples
- Cultural references: Johnny Appleseed
- Symbolic meaning: multiple depending human interpretation

LLMs rely upon the decomposition of words into semantic tokens that are given coordinate values. The coordinate values are determined by mapping sequential identifiers to concepts in a data dictionary. The position of the tokens in a vector graph results in the distribution of tokens within a vector space. The angular relationship of vectors can be used to infer conceptual analogy. The closer two vectors, the closer their semantic meaning to the other. When dealing with more conceptual, abstract topics, the number of vectors required to discover angular relationships results in a tendency towards perpendicular angular relationships between all vectors.

The symbolic vector is important for representing perceptions because the human mind seeks to unite each input with a concept. Symbols, which indirectly but precisely convey meaning, are used by humans to best express concepts. In human perception, the input does not form the concept, rather, concepts exist in humans beyond the grasp of human language, seeking to express form based on the stimulus of an input to which is unites. The union of input with concept results in the percept, the form of which is the symbolic representation of the concept.

The goal of the Memorativa system is to use a small set of conceptual vectors that use a culturally encoded symbolic dictionary already embedded in English language LLM training data sets. These sets can be efficiently extended with the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to incorporate mythological / symbolic reference libraries. By focusing on the efficient encoding of the conceptual categorization of percepts, Memorativa seeks to solve for the problem of perpendicular angular relationships in vector space conceptual analysis.

Memorativa can then be used by humans to help visualize and extend conceptual thinking, while machines can use Memorativa to better and more efficiently infer and conceptualize input.

## Percept-triplet

In the Memorativa model, human perception can be conceptually categorized according to three conceptual vectors, called the **percept-triplet**:

- **What**: the archetype - *the archetype vector*
- **How**: the form of expression of the archetype - *the expression vector*
- **Where**: the form of expression of the archetype in the conceptual field of activity - *the mundane vector*

Percept-triplets can be applied to humans, things, and events to calculate encapsulating concepts. Keywords can be used as identifiers to analogically correlate percepts to a data dictionary of concepts.

Western mythology and symbology provide prototypes that are encoded into the English language and culture (which is of concern to large language models and other semantic processors) and that can serve as the "data dictionary" for percept encoding.

## Percept-triplet vector 1: archetype

The **archetype vector** is defined as:

- Outside the bounds of conceptualization
- An active force and dynamic principle
- Something that can be represented by prototypes
- A conceptual goal and a kind of center of conceptual gravity for prototypes
- Universal and consistent 

Memorativa uses archetypes as the "what" vector, and specifically Western prototypes of archetypes. In Memorativa, prototypes act as the representation of the input enjoined with a concept. The more closely a prototype "gravitates" towards the conceptual field of the archetype, the more clearly the prototype expresses the encapsulating concept of the percept.

**Planets**, with their centers of gravity and symbolic potency, provide the core prototypes for the archetypal "what" vector of the percept-triplets.

These are prototypical classical Planets of Western mythology, with some conceptual correlations:

- **Sun ☉**: Identity, vitality, consciousness, purpose
- **Moon ☽**: Emotions, instincts, nurturing, cycles
- **Mercury ☿**: Communication, learning, analysis, connection
- **Venus ♀**: Values, relationships, harmony, attraction
- **Mars ♂**: Action, drive, assertion, energy
- **Jupiter ♃**: Expansion, wisdom, growth, opportunity
- **Saturn ♄**: Structure, limitation, responsibility, time

These are the prototypical modern Planets, with some conceptual correlations:

- **Uranus ♅**: Innovation, freedom, disruption, awakening
- **Neptune ♆**: Spirituality, dissolution, imagination, unity
- **Pluto ♇**: Transformation, power, depth, regeneration

Each of these conceptual correlations are multivariate depending on if the reference is something personal, mundane, or itself conceptual. Thus "Sun" can be used to conceptually categorize people, events, or things.

Each of these conceptual correlations (and all correlations in the percept-triplet) have a certain cosmological orientation, that is, of an object in time and space on Earth.

## Percept-triplet vector 2: expression

The **expression vector** represents the form and expression of the archetype (the "How" vector) and is defined by:

- One of twelve symbols that modify the Planet archetypal force
- A representation of style, tone, and modality for the archetype
- The expression and manifestation of the archetype
- Determines how force is channeled

In keeping with an analogous structure to represent the different kinds of modalities and expressions of a Planet, the Western mythological classification of the constellations demarcating the ecliptic, the **Zodiac Signs**, serve as the twelve primary symbols of the "How" vector. According to the established mythology, each Zodiacal Sign has a "ruling" Planet that encodes a further vector of conceptual significance. In the case of the conceptual correlations for Signs, the vector particularly relates to the observer's understanding of the nature of the percept as an expression of the archetype.

Signs provide many additional correlated conceptual vectors, such as body parts, plants and minerals, month of the year, ruling Planet, etc.

| **Sign**                          |  **Modes**                |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **♈ Aries, The Ram**              |  Energetic                |
| **♉ Taurus, The Bull**            |  Reliable                 |
| **♊ Gemini, The Twins**           |  Expressive               |
| **♋ Cancer, The Crab**            |  Protective               |
| **♌ Leo, The Lion**               |  Dramatic                 |

| **♎ Libra, The Scales**           |  Harmonious               |
| **♏ Scorpio, The Scorpion**       |  Intense                  |

| **♓ Pisces, The Fish**            |  Artistic                 |

## Percept-triplet vector 3: mundane

The **mundane vector** (the "Where") is the area of reality where the archetypal form of expression manifests, and is defined by:

- One of 12 areas called Houses
- The operational zone of activity for the percept
- Correlations to cycles, times, phases, and durations of human observed events
- Grounds symbolism in tangible reality, reflecting where energies manifest most visibly

Houses are categorized in Western astrology as follows:

| **House**                                |  **Area**                 |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|  **1st: The Ascendant**                  |  Identity                 |
|  **2nd: The House of Value**             |  Resources                |
|  **3rd: The House of Communication**     |  Learning                 |
|  **4th: The Nadir/IC**                   |  Home                     |
|  **5th: The House of Pleasure**          |  Creativity               |
|  **6th: The House of Service**           |  Routine                  |
|  **7th: The Descendant**                 |  Relationships            |
|  **8th: The House of Transformation**    |  Shared resources         |
|  **9th: The House of Philosophy**        |  Beliefs                  |
|  **10th: The Midheaven/MC**              |  Authority                |
|  **11th: The House of Friendship**       |  Groups                   |
|  **12th: The House of the Unconscious**  |  Hidden matters           |

## Example encoding of a percept to concept using the percept-triplet method

In this example, the Memorativa percept-triplet method is used to conceptualize an input. The output is a Planet expressed in a Sign manifested in a House.

Define an **input** as:

- **URL**
- **Title**
- **Description**

For example:

- **URL**: link to a photo of an apple
- **Title**: "Eve's temptation"
- **Description**: "The apple in mythology"

Here the input is not simply an object (the apple), but a perception of the object conditioned by the observer's state and context, as reflected in the title an description.

The input—an image of an apple titled *"Eve's Temptation"* with the description *"The apple in mythology"*—can be mapped to the triplet vectors (planet-sign-house) by decoding its mythological and symbolic layers (such decoding / encoding can be accomplished using current LLM models without additional training). Below is a triplet classification informed by historical, cultural, and esoteric correspondences:

### 1. Archetype vector: Venus/Pluto

The apple’s mythological ties to **temptation** and **desire** align with:

- **Venus**: Ruler of love, beauty, and relational harmony. Apples are linked to Venus in Libra, symbolizing romantic allure and the tension between ethics (Libra’s balance) and indulgence.  
- **Pluto**: Represents taboo, transformation, and shadow work. The forbidden fruit narrative (Eve’s defiance) mirrors Pluto’s themes of confronting hidden truths and societal taboos.  
- **Ambiguity**: Venus emphasizes attraction, while Pluto underscores rebellion. The classification depends on whether the focus is on *desire* (Venus) or *transgression* (Pluto).  

### 2. Expression vector: Libra/Scorpio

The title and mythological context filter through two signs:

- **Libra**: Governed by Venus, Libra embodies choice, partnership, and moral dilemmas. The apple’s role in adjudicating “the fairest goddess” (Paris’ judgment) reflects Libra’s arbitration themes.  
- **Scorpio**: Ruled by Pluto/ Mars, Scorpio symbolizes secrets, sexuality, and rebirth. The serpent in Eden (often linked to Scorpio) re-contextualizes the apple as a catalyst for awakening primal knowledge.  

**Key Contrast**: Libra frames the apple as a *relational catalyst*, while Scorpio interprets it as a *subversive force*.  

### 3. Mundane vector: 7th/8th/9th House

The apple’s mythological roles anchor it to three life domains: 

1. **7th House (Relationships)**: Represents partnerships, contracts, and “the other.” Eve’s act of sharing the apple with Adam mirrors 7th-house dynamics of mutual influence and moral negotiation.  
2. **8th House (Taboo/Transformation)**: Governs shared resources, secrets, and rebirth. The apple’s forbidden status and its link to mortality (Genesis 3:19) align with 8th-house themes.  
3. **9th House (Beliefs/Knowledge)**: Connects to philosophy, dogma, and higher learning. The Tree of Knowledge myth positions the apple as a symbol of intellectual/spiritual awakening.  

**Dominant House**: The 9th house best captures the apple’s role in *challenging dogma* (Eve’s defiance of divine law) and seeking gnosis.  

### Synthesis and interpretation 

| **Vector**      | **Classification**                | **Rationale**                                                                 |  
|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Planet**       | Venus (primary), Pluto (secondary) | Love magic vs. transformative sin                               |  
| **Sign**         | Libra (primary), Scorpio (shadow) | Balance vs. subversion; Venusian allure vs. Plutonian taboo       |  
| **House**        | 9th House (knowledge/rebirth)     | Mythological focus on *questioning authority* and pursuing wisdom    |

## Second example encoding of a percept to concept using the percept-triplet method

In this example, the Memorativa percept-triplet method is used to conceptualize an input. This time, instead of using just one Planet to represent the percept, we'll use multiple Planets to refine the archetypal vectors, since each archetype is thematically distinct. The output is a set of Planets, each expressed in a Sign and manifested in a House.

### 1. Core Structure

The structure contains multiple layers, for example:  

1. **Dominant Sun Placement**: Represents the input’s central theme.  
2. **Planetary Sign/House Assignments**: Encodes secondary themes via zodiac/house resonance.

### 2. Dominant Sun Placement

The Sun’s position anchors the chart, derived from:

- **Symbolic Analysis**: Core themes (e.g., "Eve’s apple" → Sun in **Leo** for self-expression or **Scorpio** for taboo).  
- **House Allocation**: Determined by input context (e.g., mythology → **9th house** for philosophy).

**Example**:

- Input: "A roaring lion under a starry sky" → Sun in Leo (self-expression) in 5th house (creativity).  

### 3. Planetary Assignments

Other planets encode sub-themes using: 

- **Archetypal Databases**: Symbol-planet correspondences (e.g., conflict → Mars, love → Venus).  
- **House Context**: Life domain (e.g., "leadership struggles" → Saturn in 10th house).  


### 5. Symbolic Validation

Ensures consistency with percept-triple symbolic principles: 

- **Dignities/Detriments**: Blocks invalid placements (e.g., Moon in Capricorn prioritized over Cancer).  
- **Cultural Calibration**: Adjusts for traditions (Eastern vs. Western).  

### Example percept-triplet encoding for "Eve’s Apple"

```json  
{  
  "Sun": {"sign": "Libra", "house": "9th", "rationale": "Mythological wisdom [3][4]"},  
  "Venus": {"sign": "Taurus", "house": "2nd", "confidence": 0.8, "aspects": ["Opposite Pluto"]},  
  "Pluto": {"sign": "Scorpio", "house": "8th", "confidence": 0.7, "rationale": "Taboo/transformation [10]"}
}  
```

## Visualizing the percept-triplet in vector space

To summarize, the percept-triplet calculates an encapsulating concept for a percept based on three vectors:

- What, archetypes, Planets
- How, expression of archetypes, Signs
- Where, area of expression of archetypes, Houses

### The vector space chart

The percept-triplet chart will encode the concept into a conceptual space that retains the cosmological orientation of an object on Earth.

Create a circle and bisect it horizontally with a straight line to represent the Earth's horizon. 

Bisect the circle vertically with a straight line to represent North at the top and South at the bottom. Call the north node Midheaven and the south node Nadir. Call the east node Ascendant and the west node Descendant.

Let the left intersection of the horizon with the circle represent East and the right intersection of the horizon with the circle represent West.

Demarcate the outer perimeter of the chart into twelve sections represented by Signs.

Demarcate the inner perimeter of the chart into twelve sections represented by Houses.

The chart can now place the Planets into a spatial relationship with the Houses and Signs.

The percept-triplet chart is called a **horoscope**, and is the structure used by astrology to show the placement of the planets in the sky based on a given time, date, and location. Horoscopes are typically used to calculate the placement of the planets in the sky at the time of birth for a person, which is called the **natal chart**. Astrology also calculates horoscope charts for events in the world (**mundane astrology**) or the daily transits of planets in the sky.

For any given horoscope, planets can form angular relationships to:

- each other
- house placements
- the Ascendant or other nodes

List of major aspects:

| Aspect | Angle | Symbol | Nature | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Conjunction | 0° | ☌ | Major | Planets occupy same position; energies blend and intensify |
| Opposition | 180° | ☍ | Major | Planets face each other; creates tension and awareness |
| Trine | 120° | △ | Major | Harmonious flow of energy; brings ease and opportunity |
| Square | 90° | □ | Major | Creates tension and challenges; catalyst for growth |
| Sextile | 60° | ⚹ | Major | Favorable opportunities; requires initiative |

---

List of minor aspects:

| Aspect | Angle | Symbol | Nature | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Semi-Sextile | 30° | ⚺ | Minor | Subtle connection; slight tension |
| Semi-Square | 45° | ∠ | Minor | Minor irritation or internal tension |
| Quintile | 72° | Q | Minor | Creative and talented expression |
| Bi-Quintile | 144° | bQ | Minor | Unique gifts and abilities |
| Quincunx | 150° | ⚻ | Minor | Adjustment and adaptation required |

The Memorativa model uses the major and minor aspects as symbolic validators for the mapping of percepts to concepts and the forming of conceptual relationships.

For any given day, a mundane chart shows the placement of planets in houses and signs and their angular relationships, indicating semantic relationships between archetypes conditioned by house and sign placement (the percept-triplet structure).

To discover the relationship between an individual and the world (or another individual), two charts can be superimposed and the angular relationships discovered between them. For example, a natal chart can be superimposed with a daily transit chart to interpret the archetypal patterns for a given individual on a given day. In this case, the transiting planets can form angular relationships with the planets in the individual's natal chart. Astrologers can use a natal chart as a canonical reference and representation for the individual, as it will encode the same birth sky chart into each chart's angular relationship analysis. In this way, the natal chart serves an analogous role as the reference beam in the construction of a hologram, maintaining a consistent resonant template across time periods.

Where astrology typically uses horoscopes to calculate the placement of the actual planets in the sky for an actual person, object, or event, Memorativa uses horoscopes to calculate the placement of imaginary planets in a conceptual space based on human perceptions which may or may not be of objects on Earth in space and time (e.g. memories, dreams, reflections). These **imaginaries** (planets and spaces) are structures generated by the union of percepts with concepts inside the imaginary space of the human mind. As such, they do not require time vectors.

Just like real planets, real objects, and real events, imaginaries can be shown on a horoscope chart and their angular relationships discovered. Without time vectors, the placement of planets cannot be calculated to any degree placement, only placement *in* a house and sign. If the time vector is known, then the a value of 0 - 29 degrees can be calculated for the exact placement of the planet din the sign.

### Conceptual time

Percept-triplets do not require a time vector to successfully encode a percept into a concept, but a time vector can be added to the percept-triplet to represent conceptual time states:

- **Mundane time state**: a past or future timestamp that relates to the concept, such as the time and date the percept was added to the system, or the date referenced by the content of the percept, or an imagined future date related to an imagined future event
- **Quantum time state**: a conceptual state of indeterminate or no time, or immeasurable present time
- **Holographic time state**: a conceptual time state associated with a percept that is attuned to a reference time, such as a natal chart

With the addition of the conceptual time vector to a percept-triplet, the concept can be placed exactly in time and space on the chart. One example of a time vector is using the time-date stamp of the entry of the input to the Memorativa system (capturing a mundane time state).

Without the time state vector, the concept remains in an indefinite *quantum state*. The quantum time state enables the "tuning" of the placement of the imaginary planet by opportunistically calculating its placement based on potential angular relationships with other planets or nodes.

Holographic time states connect superimposed charts across time states (past to past, past to future, past to conceptual, conceptual to conceptual, etc.) by using a reference chart against one or more superimposed charts.
