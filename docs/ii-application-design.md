# Memorativa
# II. Application Design
 This document focuses on the product features, user experience, and systems needed to implement the game.

 ---

Application use includes:

1. **ETL**: The collection and curation of content.
2. **Memory Houses**: Working with tools within a visualized space where content is worked on to produce new ideas, concepts, and relationships.
3. **The Glass Bead Game**: A game that rewards the player for their thinking and creativity by way of organizing, relating, and synthesizing concepts.
4. **The Idolum**: An "agent" (powered by an engine) that uses symbolic systems and AI to surface, find, and illuminate new ideas, concepts, relationships.
5. **Symbolic lenses**: Symbolic lenses that apply different symbolic systems to the play.
6. **Glass Beads**: Game tokens are awarded and used for play and that represent and encode ideas, concepts, and relationships, as well as Proof of Human Thought (PoHT).

## How to play


## User Experience
The user experience is designed to be a workshop of ideas, concepts, and relationships, with an added layer of playfulness and game mechanics. Although future expansion lends itself and may include a more immersive, three-dimensional or even virtual reality experience, the current design is focused on a two-dimensional, web-based experience. Moreover, the system is intended to cultivate an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships, and to rely less on mechanisms that can lead to the externalization of thought.

# III. Core System Components

## ETL System
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is a core function of the system and the most foundational use case for a player.

**Extract**

Links (URLs) are the most common form of content, or representation of content.

Players can also add their own text to the system and generate original images while playing the game.

**Transform**

In order to add or work with (transform) content into a concept, players must use clear beads. When a clear bead is used to transform content, it becomes an active bead, representing the worked concept.

**Load**

The most simple and first-step transformation is to add (load) content to a memory house using a clear bead as a game token, which then becomes an active bead tied to that content.
