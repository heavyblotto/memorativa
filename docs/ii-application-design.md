# Memorativa: Part II. Application Design

 This document focuses on the game design, product features, user experience, and systems needed to implement the game.

## Game Description

This section provides a wholistic, high-level description of the application and game, what it does, how it works, and its purpose. The application is designed around concepts and principles discussed in Part I: Vision. 

### Game overview

Memorativa is a web application that users register to play and use as both a game and a tool. 

At its simplest, Memorativa is a manager for URLs and notes, and a user can derive great benefit from this feature alone. It takes the form of a game, giving the player prompts to add various kinds of categories of content at different times for different reasons.

At its most ambitious, Memorativa is a game of ideas, concepts, and relationships.

### How to play

1. The game prompts you to reply with some thoughts or for some content to add. The **prompt** includes some image that represents the prompt. The player may also ask the game for prompts. Prompts have properties such as a duration, theme, and a location in the game.

2. The player responds by replying and / or adding a link to content. Replies may include links to tweets, videos, books, memes, images, etc. Replies represent a certain **perception** from the player in response to the prompt.

3. The game analyzes the reply and provides the player with additional essential information and metadata. The reply helps to inform the AI about your interests and how you like to explore ideas, which is reflected in future prompts. The player can refine the analyzed reply to better suit his intentions.

4. The AI stores the reply along with the analysis, established relationships, and a new associated image in a memory house. Memory houses help organize prompts and replies into an intuitive and meaningful information model, augmented by the game's AI agent. The reply may live in a different memory house from the location of the prompt that it's related to. Replies serve as nodes to generate relationships between other replies, or for further reflection to generate related replies, thereby forming a network of concepts.

5. As more replies are added, the AI provides more prompts for the player to consider. Each prompt (and reply) has a location and home within the memory house system. Players can discover new prompts by exploring the memory houses through different perspectives (personal, organizational, conceptual, or temporal) and interacting with the AI. The game rewards players for successfully completed prompts and more sophisticated and elegant replies.

6. As players add more replies to the game, they may also start replying to prompts related to existing replies. In such cases, the new reply lives in its own memory house but stands in a relationship to the original reply. The relationship itself is represented as a reply in the memory houses. Replies that represent new relationships are considered ideas. Replies to existing ideas are concepts.

7. Intuitive tools and features are provided to the player to help organize, explore, and play with the symbols, concepts, ideas, and relationships that are discovered and cultivated within the prompt-reply system of the memory houses. As the player progresses, relationships are uncovered, connections are made, and concepts are formed within the memory house model as the AI continues to understand the player's preferences, interests, and curiosity across different perspectives, and continually surfaces related relationships, symbols, and new prompts to explore.

8. Each prompt, reply, relationship, idea, and concept is represented with a glass bead in the memory houses. Glass beads are tokens that indicate the location of the prompt in the houses according to the represented prompt's or reply's properties. Different grades of bead represent different kinds of prompts and replies that are related to it: prompt > reply > relationships > ideas > concepts.

Prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts have locations and places in the memory houses based on their theme and related categories. 

Creating replies to prompts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "perception" beads. They denote successfully addressed prompts in the game.

Creating relationships generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "relationship" beads. They denote successfully related replies and prompts in the game.

Creating concepts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "synthesis" beads. They denote successfully synthesized concepts in the game.

As play progresses, the AI will continue to guide the player with AI analysis to help the player synthesize concepts and ideas that arise from the relationships, replies and prompts. It will also ensure that the player attends to the entire ecosystem of the game.

After a certain amount of game play, **symbolic lenses** become available to the player to better understand  memory houses and their concepts and relationships. Symbolic lenses work in conjunction with perspectives, further refining the player's experience.

The first symbolic lens to unlock is the **astrological lens**, which begins a progressive disclosure of the various mechanics, symbols, times and durations associated with the astrological system. The use of the horoscope chart (with details and variations progressively shown to the player) is the primary symbolic chart for the symbolic lens.

The player may ask the AI any questions about the game, the rules, the memory houses, the perspectives, the lenses, or the glass beads. He may ask about new or existing prompts or replies, or suggestions for new prompts and replies to add to the memory houses that could follow a long-term exploration or curation strategy.

In this way, the AI prompts guide the player through advanced use of prompts, replies, and exploration of the classification system of the memory houses.

## Memory houses

Players use memory houses as primary navigation and as gameplay spaces in the game.

The main game view for the player is a 3 by 4 grid of the memory houses.

Each memory house also has a main house detail view.

From the main game view, the player is able to start exploring and playing the game based on certain simple visual cues and affordances.

While in the memory house detail view, the player will be able to further explore and play the game according the to themes and functions of each of the houses.

### Memory house categorization

The AI categorizes prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts according to the following properties:

- Topic (subject matter and domain)
- Media type (text, video, image, audio, etc.)
- Function or use (purpose and application)
- Relations to time and occurrence (temporal aspects)
- Personal and public (visibility level)
- Shared and private (access control)

## Perspectives

**Perspectives** are different ways for players to explore and interact with the memory houses, providing higher-level interpretative frameworks that determine how players approach prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts. 

**Lenses** are the specific symbolic systems and tools used to implement those perspectives.

For example:

- When using the "Personal/Natal perspective", you might employ the "Astrological Lens" to interpret personal birth charts

- When using the "Mundane organization perspective", you might use the same "Astrological Lens" but focus on different aspects (like house meanings for project management)

## Glass beads

Glass beads serve as both game tokens and storage tokens within Memorativa. Each glass bead encapsulates the data, metadata, and attributes of a prompt, reply, relationship, or concept within the game. Every glass bead is visually represented by a dynamic AI-generated symbolic image that evolves based on actions, placement, timing, perspective and lens applications.

### Glass bead generation and combination

- AI generates prompt, unrelated to other prompts, replies, relationships, or concepts:
  - Clear-grade glass bead (p) generated (new glass bead without relationships)

- Player replies to prompt (p):
  - Perception-grade glass bead (r) generated for reply related to prompt (p)
  - Relationship-grade glass bead (x) generated for relationship related to prompt (p)

- Player replies to reply (r):
  - Relationship-grade glass bead (r1) generated for reply related to reply (r)
  - Relationship-grade glass bead (x1) generated for relationship between replies (r, r1)

- Player creates relationship between multiple replies:
  - Relationship-grade glass bead (x2) generated for explicit relationship between replies
  - Additional relationship beads (x3...xn) generated for each additional reply connected

- Player synthesizes concept from relationships:
  - Synthesis-grade glass bead (c) generated for new concept
  - Relationship-grade beads (xc) generated connecting concept to source relationships

- AI generates prompt related to existing content:
  - Clear-grade glass bead (p1) generated for new prompt
  - Relationship-grade bead (xp) generated connecting to related content

- Player combines multiple concepts:
  - Higher synthesis-grade bead (c1) generated for combined concept
  - Relationship beads (xc1) generated connecting to source concepts

- Player creates series or collection:
  - Collection-grade bead (s) generated for the series
  - Relationship beads (xs) generated connecting items in series

- Player discovers pattern or correspondence:
  - Pattern-grade bead (t) generated for the pattern
  - Relationship beads (xt) generated connecting pattern elements

- System recognizes emergent structure:
  - Structure-grade bead (e) generated for emergent pattern
  - Relationship beads (xe) generated connecting structural elements

- Player achieves game milestone:
  - Achievement-grade bead (a) generated for milestone
  - Relationship beads (xa) generated connecting achievement elements

Each type of glass bead has distinct visual properties reflecting its grade and relationships, creating an evolving tapestry of interconnected thought and discovery within the memory houses.
