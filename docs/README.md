# Memorativa Documentation

This documentation outlines the Memorativa system, a framework for active understanding and systematic prototype construction that addresses the curse of dimensionality in AI through pre-linguistic symbolic frameworks.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into five main sections:

1. **Introduction**: Philosophical foundation and core concepts
2. **The Cybernetic System**: System architecture and feedback mechanisms
3. **The Machine System**: Technical implementation details
4. **The Pantheon System**: Symbolic frameworks and archetypal structures
5. **The Memorativa System**: Final system design and integration

Each section builds conceptually on the previous ones, creating a chain of thought that culminates in the complete Memorativa system design.

## Front Matter Template

Each documentation file includes YAML front matter with the following fields:

```yaml

### Front Matter Fields

- **title**: The title of the document
- **section**: The main section number (1-5)
- **subsection**: The subsection number within the section

- **summary**: A concise summary of the document's content and purpose
- **chain_of_thought**: The logical progression of ideas within the document
- **technical_components**: Technical elements or systems discussed in the document

## Document Structure

Each document should follow a consistent structure to ensure clarity and coherence across the documentation:

1. **Title**: The document title as an H1 heading
2. **Introduction**: A brief introduction to the topic
3. **Main Content**: The core content of the document, organized into logical sections with appropriate headings
4. **Key Points**: A summary of the key points and chain-of-thought presented in the document
5. **Key Math**: Mathematical proofs and formulations that support the document's concepts (when applicable)
6. **Citations**: References to sources and related documents

### Key Points Section

Each document must include a "Key Points" section before the Citations section. This section should:

1. Provide a human-readable summary of the most important concepts presented in the document
2. Explain the chain-of-thought for the concepts where relevant
3. Connect the document's concepts to the broader Memorativa system
4. Include citations to relevant sources and related documents
5. Be formatted as bullet points for easy scanning and comprehension

Example format:

```markdown
## Key Points

- The system implements [concept] using [approach], which enables [benefit] [citation]
- [Concept A] connects to [Concept B] through [relationship], creating [outcome] [citation]
- The chain of thought progresses from [starting point] to [conclusion] through [steps] [citation]
- This approach addresses [challenge] by leveraging [solution] [citation]
- Future development will focus on [next steps] to enhance [capabilities] [citation]
```

### Key Math Section

When a document contains mathematical concepts, proofs, or formulations (either implicit or explicit), it should include a "Key Math" section after the Key Points section. This section should:

1. Formalize any mathematical concepts that are implicit in the text
2. Provide clear, step-by-step proofs for mathematical claims
3. Define variables, functions, and notation used in mathematical expressions
4. Connect mathematical formulations to the conceptual framework
5. Include citations to relevant mathematical literature or related documents

Example format:

```markdown
## Key Math

- **Vector Space Representation**: The encoding of concepts into vector spaces can be formalized as a function $f: C \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ where $C$ is the set of concepts and $n$ is the dimensionality of the vector space [citation]

- **Similarity Measure**: The similarity between two concepts $c_1$ and $c_2$ is computed as the cosine similarity between their vector representations:
  $\text{sim}(c_1, c_2) = \frac{f(c_1) \cdot f(c_2)}{||f(c_1)|| \cdot ||f(c_2)||}$ [citation]

- **Proof of Convergence**: The iterative refinement process converges because [mathematical proof with steps] [citation]

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: The mapping from high-dimensional to low-dimensional space preserves semantic relationships through [mathematical formulation] [citation]
```

Not all documents will require a Key Math section. It should be included only when mathematical concepts are central to understanding the document's content.

## Citation Format

Each document should include a "Citations" section at the end with a standardized format for references. Citations should be numbered sequentially in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2]) and referenced in the text using these numbers.

### Citation Format Template

```markdown
## Citations

- [1] Author, A. (Year). *Title of Book*. Publisher.
- [2] Author, B., & Author, C. (Year). "Title of Article." *Journal Name*, Volume(Issue), Page-Range.
- [3] Author, D. (Year). "Title of Chapter." In *Title of Book* (pp. Page-Range), Editor, E. (Ed.). Publisher.
- [4] Author, E. (Year). *Title of Web Resource*. Organization. URL
- [5] [Section X.Y] Internal reference to another section of the Memorativa documentation.
```

### Citation Guidelines

1. **Books**: Author(s), year, italicized title, publisher.
2. **Journal Articles**: Author(s), year, quoted title, italicized journal name, volume, issue, page range.
3. **Book Chapters**: Author(s), year, quoted title, italicized book title, page range, editor(s), publisher.
4. **Web Resources**: Author(s), year, italicized title, organization, URL (optional).
5. **Internal References**: Use [Section X.Y] format to reference other sections of the Memorativa documentation.

All documents should include citations, even if they only reference other sections of the documentation. This ensures proper attribution and provides readers with resources for further exploration.

## Purpose

This documentation structure serves several important purposes:

1. **Conceptual Tracking**: Clearly shows how concepts build upon each other
2. **Dependency Management**: Identifies prerequisites and subsequent concepts
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks the status and development of documentation
4. **Content Indexing**: Enables quick searching and filtering of content
5. **Synthetic Summation**: Facilitates the creation of comprehensive summaries at checkpoints
6. **Machine Processing**: Provides structured metadata for automated analysis
7. **Knowledge Consolidation**: The Key Points section ensures critical concepts are highlighted and connected

The chain-of-thought fields and Key Points sections are particularly important as they make explicit the logical progression of ideas throughout the documentation, culminating in the final system design in Section 5.

## Checkpoints and Summations

At the end of each section, a checkpoint document will provide a synthetic, comprehensive summation of the conceptual state at that point. These checkpoints will:

1. Consolidate key concepts introduced in the section
2. Show how these concepts build upon previous sections
3. Prepare the reader for the next section's concepts
4. Track the overall progression toward the final system design

The final checkpoint in Section 5 will provide the complete Memorativa system design, representing the culmination of the entire chain of thought developed throughout the documentation.
