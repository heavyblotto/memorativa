# Memorativa Documentation

This documentation outlines the Memorativa system, a framework for active understanding and systematic prototype construction that addresses the curse of dimensionality in AI through pre-linguistic symbolic frameworks.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into five main sections:

1. **Introduction**: Philosophical foundation and core concepts
2. **The Cybernetic System**: System architecture and feedback mechanisms
3. **The Machine System**: Technical implementation details
4. **The Pantheon System**: Symbolic frameworks and archetypal structures
5. **The Memorativa System**: Final system design and integration

Each section builds conceptually on the previous ones, creating a chain of thought that culminates in the complete Memorativa system design.

## Front Matter Template

Each documentation file includes YAML front matter with the following fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
section: 1-5
subsection: 1-n
order: 1-n
status: "draft|in-progress|complete|review"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
contributors: []
key_concepts:
  - "Concept 1"
  - "Concept 2"
prerequisites:
  - "Prerequisite Concept 1"
  - "Prerequisite Concept 2"
next_concepts:
  - "Next Concept 1"
  - "Next Concept 2"
summary: "A concise summary of the document's content and purpose."
chain_of_thought:
  - "Step 1 in the logical progression"
  - "Step 2 in the logical progression"
technical_components:
  - "Component 1"
  - "Component 2"

```

### Front Matter Fields

- **title**: The title of the document
- **section**: The main section number (1-5)
- **subsection**: The subsection number within the section
- **order**: The order of the document within its subsection
- **status**: The current status of the document
- **last_updated**: The date the document was last updated
- **contributors**: List of contributors to the document
- **key_concepts**: The main concepts introduced or discussed in the document
- **prerequisites**: Concepts that should be understood before reading this document
- **next_concepts**: Concepts that build upon this document
- **summary**: A concise summary of the document's content and purpose
- **chain_of_thought**: The logical progression of ideas within the document
- **technical_components**: Technical elements or systems discussed in the document

## Citation Format

Each document should include a "Citations" section at the end with a standardized format for references. Citations should be numbered sequentially in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2]) and referenced in the text using these numbers.

### Citation Format Template

```markdown
## Citations

- [1] Author, A. (Year). *Title of Book*. Publisher.
- [2] Author, B., & Author, C. (Year). "Title of Article." *Journal Name*, Volume(Issue), Page-Range.
- [3] Author, D. (Year). "Title of Chapter." In *Title of Book* (pp. Page-Range), Editor, E. (Ed.). Publisher.
- [4] Author, E. (Year). *Title of Web Resource*. Organization. URL
- [5] [Section X.Y] Internal reference to another section of the Memorativa documentation.
```

### Citation Guidelines

1. **Books**: Author(s), year, italicized title, publisher.
2. **Journal Articles**: Author(s), year, quoted title, italicized journal name, volume, issue, page range.
3. **Book Chapters**: Author(s), year, quoted title, italicized book title, page range, editor(s), publisher.
4. **Web Resources**: Author(s), year, italicized title, organization, URL (optional).
5. **Internal References**: Use [Section X.Y] format to reference other sections of the Memorativa documentation.

All documents should include citations, even if they only reference other sections of the documentation. This ensures proper attribution and provides readers with resources for further exploration.

## Purpose

This front matter structure serves several important purposes:

1. **Conceptual Tracking**: Clearly shows how concepts build upon each other
2. **Dependency Management**: Identifies prerequisites and subsequent concepts
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks the status and development of documentation
4. **Content Indexing**: Enables quick searching and filtering of content
5. **Synthetic Summation**: Facilitates the creation of comprehensive summaries at checkpoints
6. **Machine Processing**: Provides structured metadata for automated analysis

The chain-of-thought fields are particularly important as they make explicit the logical progression of ideas throughout the documentation, culminating in the final system design in Section 5.

## Checkpoints and Summations

At the end of each section, a checkpoint document will provide a synthetic, comprehensive summation of the conceptual state at that point. These checkpoints will:

1. Consolidate key concepts introduced in the section
2. Show how these concepts build upon previous sections
3. Prepare the reader for the next section's concepts
4. Track the overall progression toward the final system design

The final checkpoint in Section 5 will provide the complete Memorativa system design, representing the culmination of the entire chain of thought developed throughout the documentation.
