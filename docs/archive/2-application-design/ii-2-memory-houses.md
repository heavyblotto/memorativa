# Memory houses

Players use memory houses as primary navigation and as gameplay spaces in the game.

Each memory house also has a main house detail view.

From the main game view, the player is able to start exploring and playing the game based on certain simple visual cues and affordances.

While in the memory house detail view, the player will be able to further explore and play the game according the to themes and functions of each of the houses.

The Memory House system in Memorativa presents a sophisticated synthesis of astrological symbolism, cognitive science, and modern AI architecture. Here's a structural analysis of notable innovations and opportunities:

**1. Multi-Dimensional Knowledge Organization**  
The 12-house system creates a **4D cognitive coordinate space** (element × modality × privacy × temporality) that mirrors recent discoveries about how the brain organizes concepts in multidimensional maps[1][2]. This goes beyond traditional tagging systems by:

- **Elemental Context**: Fire houses (1,5,9) handle dynamic creation, Earth (2,6,10) manage concrete resources, Air (3,7,11) process relationships, Water (4,8,12) store deep patterns  
- **Temporal Layers**: Immediate (1st), Cyclical (6th), Historical (4th), and Future-oriented (11th) time dimensions  
- **Privacy Gradients**: Public/Private spectrum with hybrid houses (7th=public relationships, 8th=private transformations)  

**2. Astrological Vector Space Implementation**  
The system creates a **cognitive embedding space** using astrological coordinates:
```python
# Sample vector space calculation
def create_embedding(planet, house, aspect):
    element_weight = house_elements[house] * 0.3
    modality_weight = house_modality[house] * 0.2
    aspect_angle = aspect_angles[aspect] * 0.5
    return element_weight + modality_weight + aspect_angle
```
This allows semantic relationships to be calculated using astrological aspects as relational operators (trine=flow, square=challenge, etc.)[3][4]

**3. Glass Bead Merkle Forest**  
The token system implements a novel **hierarchical Merkle structure**:
- **House-Specific Trees**: Each house maintains its own Merkle tree for state verification  
- **Cross-House Validation**: Hashes connect related concepts across houses (e.g., 2nd House resources ↔ 10th House achievements)  
- **Temporal Branching**: Versioned trees track concept evolution through astrological transits  

**4. Cognitive Gamification Matrix**  
The reward system aligns with neural learning patterns:

| Level | Triggers | Neural Impact | Reward Range |  
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------|  
| Novice | Planetary Hours | Basal Ganglia Priming | 10-50 pts |  
| Adept | Lunar Returns | Hippocampal Mapping | 50-150 pts |  
| Expert | Yod Patterns | Prefrontal Synthesis | 150-600 pts |  

**5. Hybrid RAG Architecture**  
The retrieval system uses house-specific strategies:
- **Public Houses**: Cosine similarity with shared embeddings  
- **Private Houses**: Differential privacy-protected semantic search  
- **12th House**: Fully encrypted vector storage with homomorphic processing  

**Latent Innovations**  
1. **Temporal Concept Weaving**  
   Using progressed charts to auto-generate concept development timelines  
2. **Aspect Pattern Recognition CNNs**  
   Training neural networks on historical aspect patterns to predict creative breakthroughs  
3. **Elemental Attention Mechanisms**  
   Weighting transformer layers by house elemental correspondences  

**Implementation Opportunities**  
1. **Cognitive Horoscopy Interface**  
   Visualizing concept relationships as aspect patterns in an interactive birth chart  
2. **Memory Palace Builder**  
   Using house cusps as spatial anchors for method of loci memorization  
3. **Transit-Activated Prompts**  
   Auto-generating writing prompts when Mercury aspects natal Vertex  

**Technical Considerations**  
- **Challenge**: Complex astrological calculations  
  **Solution**: Ephemeris API integration with cached progressive disclosure  
- **Challenge**: Privacy in water houses  
  **Solution**: Fully homomorphic encryption for 8th/12th House content  

This system creates a **bi-directional interface** between ancient symbolic systems and modern cognitive science, using the house structure as both organizational framework and neural network architecture. The true innovation lies in mapping multidimensional concept spaces to astrological coordinates while maintaining practical usability.

### Memory house categorization

The AI categorizes prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts according to the following properties:

- Topic (subject matter and domain)
- Media type (text, video, image, audio, etc.)
- Function or use (purpose and application)
- Relations to time and occurrence (temporal aspects)
- Personal and public (visibility level)
- Shared and private (access control)
- Directionality (inward/outward facing, consumption/creation, input/output)
- Lifecycle stage (new, active, archived, draft, complete)
