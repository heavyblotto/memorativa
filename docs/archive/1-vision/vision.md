"Memorativa" is the name of the system described in this document. Memorativa is also the name of the app that models the system in a game.

## Play the game

1. A player adds a URL and descriptive title to Memorativa. The URL links to a photo, video, tweet, pin, meme, NFT, document, song, or anything represented digitally.
2. Memorativa asks for some description for the input. Based on the original URL, title text, player description, and system analysis, the system creates a new percept. The percept is defined as the association of a matched concept to the original input based on conceptual analysis of the input.
3. Memorativa displays the concept (that contains the percept) in a two-dimensional circular graph.
4. The concept is shown as a "glass bead" of a certain color with certain properties and bearing an image and title.
5. The glass bead is located in one of 12 pie sections inside the circle. Each section (a memory house) represents a conceptual location. The concept represented by the glass bead is shown in relation to other concepts that have been represented in the memory houses (represented as other glass beads located in the circle graph). The graph shows all of the concepts that have been active with new percepts during the day.
6. Selecting a given glass bead enlarges the view of the glass bead to a circle and presents a circular graph identical to previous circular graph. Inside the graph, the percept is also represented as a glass bead and is located in one of 12 pie sections of the circle. At the center of the circle is the representative image (the prototype) for the concept. The concept prototype is the same prototype as the singleton percept.
7. Inside the graph of the concept, it is possible to associate additional percepts. This conceptual space is conducive to inductive reasoning.
8. In a concept with multiple percepts, the percept that most closely represents the concept is the single representative prototype.
9. The percepts and concepts represented by glass beads in the circular graph can be "tuned" by the player.

    - Depending on the conceptual time associated with the percept, the glass bead will be located with a degree measurement (0-29) circumscribed along the curved edge of the pie slice. What is "conceptual time"? It is a temporal representation associated with the percept. For example: the time associated with a memory, or the time associated with a future event, or the time associated the entry of the percept into the system. A single percept has multiple time vectors, and thus is associated with multiple concepts with multiple locations in the memory houses.
    - Glass beads with no time associations (such as percepts of concepts) remain in an indeterminate position somewhere in the bounded zone of the memory house. They can only be instantiated in reference to another glass bead with an associated time.
    - Glass beads with prototypes best representing the associated concept are arranged in bands located closer to the center of the circular graph.

Following these steps, the player has played the entry-level phase of the game, that is, the collection of percepts into concepts. Within the implied rules of the game, each percept is represented by a prototype (image + title), and the goal of collection is to find the most representative prototype for a given concept. In order to "call-forth" concepts, players must add correlated percepts. How this "calling forth" comes about based upon player-provided context (in words) and semantic analysis.

Summary of gameplay concepts:

- *percepts*: individual inputs
- *concepts*: collected percept clusters
- *prototypes*: representative memes

Summary of gameplay time:

- *mundane* time: real-world events in the past or future
- *holographic* time: personal timelines encoded by a birthday timestamp
- *quantum* time: conceptual space without specified time, the present 

Direction of gameplay:

> *Percept* (URL+description) → *Concept* (house grouping) → *Prototype* (dominant meme)  

## Model of thought

Humans are animals who think, using both intellect and imagination. The products of thinking activity are ideas and concepts. The Memorativa application is designed to help visualize and organize concepts in ways that are fun and beneficial to humans.

To start playing with ideas and concepts, some definitions are helpful, including a working model for thought called "the world as percept" model:

1. Concepts: What a concept is cannot be expressed in words. Words can do no more than draw our attention to the fact that we have concepts. 
2. Perceptions of objects: When someone perceives an object (e.g. a tree or a memory), the perception acts as a stimulus for thought.
3. Ideal element: An ideal element is then added to the perceived object, and the perceiver regards the object and its ideal complement as belonging together. 
4. Ideal counterpart: When the object disappears from the field of his perception, the ideal counterpart alone remains. 
5. Concept remains: This remaining ideal counterpart is the concept of the object. 
6. The wider the range of our experience, the larger becomes the number of our concepts. 
7. Moreover, concepts are not by any means found in isolation one from the other. They combine to form an ordered and systematic whole. 
8. The concept "organism," e.g., combines with the concepts of "development according to law," "growth," and others. 
9. Other concepts based on particular objects fuse completely with one another.
10. All concepts formed from particular lions fuse into the universal concept "lion." 
11. In this way, all the separate concepts combine to form a closed, conceptual system within which each has its special place. 
12. Ideas do not differ qualitatively from concepts. In the model of thought, an idea is a percept of a percept (such as the recollection of a memory, or the contemplation of a thought). In this way, percepts can take input from the sensory world or from the interior world of the person.

With this "model of thought", one can begin to design a system that reflects an inner ecology of thinking, so that one may better regard and attend to this "systematic whole" that serves as an interior cosmos.

## Memorativa system

The Memorativa system applies a practical model of thought to the human-computer interface. In order to arrive at this experientially-derived model (it's metaphysical status is irrelevant), a human needs to first be capable of observing thinking. Once achieved through a process of reflection that disconnects the observer from the unity of the observed, the observer enters a conceptual space where the thought process can be contemplated. One observes that 1) observation precedes thought in linear time and 2) concepts cannot be derived from observation, but are attracted to and unite with them as prototypes. Thus the act of perception (in time) is the uniting of object with concept, resulting in percept, represented by prototype. The Memorativa human-computer interface seeks to digitally represent the following:

1. A human observes reality (that which is not engendered by the human) and focuses on some object to understand it.
2. In the act of perception, the human unites the object with a concept, forming the percept.
3. The concept represents the union of the percept with a prototype.
4. A concept can relate and hold multiple percepts in relation, but one prototype always represents one concept.
5. The alignment of a prototype to its concept is a measure of the prototype's memetic strength. The meme synthesizes the percept with concept into the most representative prototype.
6. The human nature to collect things, establish personal taste and style, to cultivate and apply the purely subjective is a continuous process of conceptually refining and nominating representative prototypes.

## Percept management

Rather than to only seek to model and represent the physical properties of objects, the Memorativa system seeks to model and represent the conceptual properties of percepts. Percepts provide the input in time to a system of symbols which provide a availability of prototypes that represent the union of concepts in the act of perception in conceptual space. Management of percepts is their conceptual tuning in conceptual spaces.

## Imaginaries

The "world as percept" model enhances existing vector-space conceptual frameworks by the mapping of percepts in imaginary spaces to imaginary objects generated from symbolic data dictionaries mapped to geo-spatial / time coordinates. In this "geo-spatial / time coordinate" pair, the geo-spatial side represents the ideal world, and the "time coordinate" represents the real world. Percepts mapped only to geo-spatial spaces (without a time vector) lack degree coordinates and reside in bounded field (memory house) in a quantum state (i.e. the ideal world). The pairing of time vectors to the geo-spatial provides a fixed degree coordinate (the real world). Time vectors here refer to the conceptual time of world events (mundane), subjective / personal (holographic), or indeterminate time (quantum). In this model, the geo-spatial coordinate is a unique identifier for a three-dimensional prototype (archetype, expression, field of expression) in a prototype taxonomy. This prototype taxonomy is a symbolic system or systems of correlations. The symbolic system of correlations for the Memorativa system is Western astrology and the use of the horoscope (the circular graph) to map imaginary objects in imaginary spaces (i.e. imaginaries).

The three-dimensional prototype is defined by the "percept-triplet" of a planet in a sign in a house. This planet-sign-house percept-triplet is composed of the symbolic correlations for:

- Archetypal force: the planet
- Mode of expression for the archetypal force: the sign
- Field of activity for the expressed archetypal force: the house

Thus, for any percept, the Memorativa AI system can use conventional semantic analysis based on a Memorativa-specific Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to generate a percept-triplet.

The RAG serves as the concept data dictionary, from which percepts summon forth a complimentary concept. The summoning forth activity is based on the construction of an imaginary planet in imaginary space.

1. The percept is identified with a major planetary archetype. For example:

    - Neptune: technology, transcendence

2. The percept is identified with the house for the archetype. For example:

    - 1st house: new initiatives 

3. The percept is identified with a sign for the archetype. For example:

    - Pisces: artistic transcendental spaces

Here's a concrete example of a percept and its generated percept-triplet within the Memorativa system:
