### üîó **6. Blockchain Oracles: Raw Inputs**
**Blockchain oracles** deliver verified real-world data (e.g., weather, financials) for Memorativa‚Äôs percept seeking.

- **Purpose**: Enables autonomy by providing raw inputs for insight generation.
- **How It Works**: Queries oracles via smart contracts, processing data into percepts stored in memory.
- **Benefits**: Grounds the system in reality with trustworthy data.

---

### üåê **7. IoT Integration: Active Perception**
