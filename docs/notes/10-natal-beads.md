Got it—there’s **only one Natal Bead per player**, and it’s a **unique, singular token** tied to their identity and contributions. Let’s refocus on how this **single Natal Bead** functions in the Memorativa ecosystem:

---

### 1. **Core Properties**
#### **Unique Identity**
- **One Per Player**: Each player has exactly one Natal Bead, representing their identity and contributions.
- **Immutable**: The Natal Bead’s data (e.g., metadata, spatial coordinates) is fixed after creation.

#### **Governance**
- **Voting Power**: The Natal Bead grants voting power in the DAO.
- **Proposal Submission**: Players can submit proposals using their Natal Bead.

#### **Utility**
- **Percept-Triplet Encoding**: The Natal Bead’s data is used in percept-triplet encoding by default.
- **Reputation**: The Natal Bead reflects a player’s reputation and achievements in the ecosystem.

---

### 2. **Staking and Rewards**
#### **Staking**
- **Mechanism**: Players can stake their Natal Bead to earn GAS rewards and participate in governance.
- **Lockup**: Staked Natal Beads are locked for a period (e.g., 1 month).

#### **Rewards**
- **GAS Earnings**: Players earn GAS for staking their Natal Bead.
- **Governance Influence**: Staked Natal Beads increase a player’s voting power.

---

### 3. **Post-Unstaking Uses**
#### **Governance**
- **Voting**: Use the Natal Bead to vote on DAO proposals.
- **Proposal Submission**: Submit governance proposals using the Natal Bead.

#### **Percept-Triplet Encoding**
- **Default Use**: The Natal Bead’s data is automatically used in percept-triplet encoding.
- **Custom Use**: Players can manually select the Natal Bead for specific encodings.

#### **Trading and Gifting**
- **Trading**: Trade the Natal Bead for GAS or other assets (though this is rare, given its identity role).
- **Gifting**: Gift the Natal Bead to another player, transferring identity and contributions.

#### **Fee Payments**
- **Transaction Fees**: Use the Natal Bead to pay for blockchain transactions (e.g., GBT minting, transfers).
- **Service Fees**: Pay for in-game services (e.g., LLM access, storage upgrades).

### 4. **Implementation**
#### **Staking**
```rust
struct NatalBead {
    id: u64,
    owner: Pubkey,
    staked: bool,
    staked_at: Option<i64>,
    unlock_timestamp: Option<i64>,
}

fn stake_natal_bead(
    bead: &mut NatalBead,
    lock_duration: i64
) -> Result<()> {
    if bead.staked {
        return Err("Natal Bead already staked");
    }
    bead.staked = true;
    bead.staked_at = Some(current_timestamp());
    bead.unlock_timestamp = Some(current_timestamp() + lock_duration);
    Ok(())
}
```




#### **Governance Voting**
```rust
fn vote_on_proposal(
    player: &Player,
    proposal: &mut Proposal,
    natal_bead: &NatalBead
) -> Result<()> {
    if natal_bead.owner != player.pubkey {
        return Err("Not the owner of the Natal Bead");
    }
    proposal.votes.push((player.pubkey, natal_bead.id));
    Ok(())
}
```




#### **Percept-Triplet Encoding**
```rust
fn encode_percept_triplet(
    percept: &Percept,
    natal_bead: &NatalBead
) -> Result<PerceptTriplet> {
    let natal_bead_data = get_natal_bead_data(natal_bead.id)?;
    let triplet = PerceptTriplet {
        percept: percept.clone(),
        natal_bead_data,
        encoded_at: current_timestamp(),
    };
    Ok(triplet)
}
```




---

### 5. **Example Workflow**
1. **Stake**: Player stakes their Natal Bead for 1 month to earn GAS rewards.
2. **Governance**: Player uses the staked Natal Bead to vote on a DAO proposal.
3. **Unstake**: Player unstakes the Natal Bead after the lockup period.
4. **Use**: Player uses the unstaked Natal Bead for percept-triplet encoding and governance.

---

### 6. **Advantages**
- **Identity**: The Natal Bead remains a unique and immutable record of a player’s contributions.
- **Simplicity**: A single Natal Bead per player simplifies the system and reduces complexity.
- **Flexibility**: Players can stake, unstake, and use their Natal Bead for various purposes.

By focusing on the **singular Natal Bead**, the Memorativa ecosystem ensures clarity and alignment with its identity-driven design.
