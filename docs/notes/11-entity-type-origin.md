Here's how to add entity type identification to Book content:

#### 18.1.2. Core Components
| Component | Subcomponents |
|-----------|---------------|
| Metadata | Title, Description, Focus Parameters, Temporal Context, Active Lenses, Version Data, **Entity Type** |
| Percept-Triplets | Planet-Sign-House combinations with title-description pairs, transformed by Lenses |
| Prototypes | Structures composed of percept-triplets, interpreted through Lenses |
| Symbolic Data | Angular relationships (aspects), MST-translated labels, filtered through Lenses |
| Narrative Content | Chapters/Sections with analytical commentary, shaped by Lenses, **Entity Origin** |
| Visualizations | Horoscope charts, aspect networks, temporal overlays, influenced by Lenses |
| Conceptual Index | Mappings between narrative elements and structured data |

#### 18.1.3. Entity Type Identification
Books track the origin of their content through:

**1. Entity Types**
- **Human**: Content created or modified by human players
- **Machine**: Content generated by the system
- **Blended**: Collaborative content combining human and machine contributions

**2. Implementation**
```mermaid
graph TD
    B[Book Content] --> ET[Entity Type]
    ET --> H[Human]
    ET --> M[Machine]
    ET --> B[Blended]
    
    H --> HC[Player ID]
    H --> HT[Timestamp]
    H --> HV[Version]
    
    M --> MA[Algorithm ID]
    M --> MT[Generation Time]
    M --> MV[Model Version]
    
    B --> BC[Contributor List]
    B --> BT[Edit History]
    B --> BV[Blend Ratio]
```

**3. Content Segregation**
- Human and machine content can be:
  - Visually distinguished in the interface
  - Filtered during analysis
  - Weighted differently in processing
  - Tracked separately in version history

```

This addition:
1. Adds entity type tracking to metadata
2. Provides clear definitions for human, machine, and blended content
3. Enables visual and analytical segregation
4. Maintains detailed tracking of contributors and generation details
