Here’s an innovative end-to-end implementation of the dual-token system that aligns with Memorativa’s themes of conceptual exploration and spatial reasoning:

---

### 1. **Token Design**
- **Glass Bead Tokens (GBT)**:
  - **Non-fungible**: Each represents a unique conceptual work (percept, prototype, book)
  - **Spatial Metadata**: Contains 3D spherical coordinates, angular relationships, and aspect significance
  - **Dynamic Value**: Value evolves based on usage, peer validation, and conceptual depth

- **Gas Bead Tokens (GAS)**:
  - **Fungible**: Used for all fee payments and operational costs
  - **Earned Through Work**: Awarded for creating, refining, and validating concepts
  - **Staking Rewards**: Players can stake GBT to earn GAS, with rewards based on the conceptual "gravity" of their work

---

### 2. **Core Mechanics**
#### **Token Minting**
```rust
fn mint_glass_bead(
    player: &Player,
    percept: &Percept,
    prototype: &Prototype
) -> Result<GlassBead> {
    let spatial_data = calculate_spatial_metadata(percept, prototype);
    let glass_bead = GlassBead {
        id: generate_unique_id(),
        owner: player.pubkey,
        spatial_data,
        quality_score: 0.0,
        last_updated: current_timestamp()
    };
    award_gas_beads(player, PlayerAction::CreatePercept, 1.0)?;
    Ok(glass_bead)
}
```


#### **Staking and Rewards**
```rust
fn stake_glass_bead(
    player: &mut Player,
    glass_bead: &GlassBead
) -> Result<()> {
    let reward = calculate_staking_reward(glass_bead);
    player.gas_bead.balance += reward;
    player.staked_beads.push(glass_bead.id);
    Ok(())
}

fn calculate_staking_reward(glass_bead: &GlassBead) -> u64 {
    let base_reward = 10;
    let quality_multiplier = glass_bead.quality_score;
    (base_reward as f64 * quality_multiplier) as u64
}
```

### 3. **Economic Flow**
#### **Creation Phase**
1. Player creates a percept-triplet → awarded GAS
2. Player forms a prototype → awarded GAS
3. Player publishes a book → awarded GAS

#### **Validation Phase**
1. Peer reviews percept/prototype → reviewer awarded GAS
2. System assesses quality → updates GBT metadata

#### **Usage Phase**
1. Player uses percept/prototype in new work → original creator earns GAS
2. Player references book → original author earns GAS

#### **Fee Payment**
1. Player pays GAS for:
   - Compute (NLP, spatial calculations)
   - Storage (percepts, prototypes, books)
   - Blockchain transactions (minting, updating GBT)

---

### 4. **Innovative Features**
#### **Conceptual Gravity**
- GBTs with more references/usage have higher "gravity"
- Higher gravity → higher staking rewards
- Gravity decays over time unless reinforced by new usage

#### **Spatial Auctions**
- Players can auction GBTs in a 3D spatial marketplace
- Bids are placed in GAS
- Auction location in 3D space affects visibility and bidding activity

#### **Prototype Merging**
- Players can merge prototypes to form higher-level concepts
- Merging burns GBTs → generates GAS
- New merged GBT inherits spatial metadata from originals

#### **RAG Contributions**
- Players contribute to the RAG system → awarded GAS
- Contributions are ranked by usefulness → higher rewards for more impactful additions

---

### 5. **End-to-End Workflow**
1. **Player Action**:
   - Create percept → mint GBT, earn GAS
   - Form prototype → update GBT, earn GAS
   - Publish book → finalize GBT, earn GAS

2. **Validation**:
   - Peer review → update GBT quality, reward reviewer with GAS
   - System assessment → update GBT metadata

3. **Usage**:
   - Reference percept/prototype → original creator earns GAS
   - Use in new work → original creator earns GAS

4. **Staking**:
   - Stake GBT → earn GAS based on quality and gravity
   - Unstake GBT → stop earning rewards

5. **Fee Payment**:
   - Pay GAS for compute, storage, and blockchain transactions
   - Burn GAS to upgrade GBT (e.g., increase storage capacity)

---

### 6. **Example Scenario**
1. Alice creates a percept → earns 10 GAS, mints GBT
2. Bob reviews Alice’s percept → earns 5 GAS, updates GBT quality
3. Alice forms a prototype → earns 50 GAS, updates GBT
4. Carol uses Alice’s prototype in her work → Alice earns 20 GAS
5. Alice stakes her GBT → earns 15 GAS/day (based on quality and gravity)
6. Alice publishes a book → earns 100 GAS, finalizes GBT

This system aligns with Memorativa’s themes by:
- Rewarding conceptual exploration and spatial reasoning
- Using spatial metadata to influence token value and rewards
- Encouraging collaboration and validation through peer review
- Maintaining economic balance with a dual-token approach
