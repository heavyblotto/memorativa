## 2 Game Description

This section provides a wholistic, high-level description of the application and game, what it does, how it works, and its purpose. The application is designed around concepts and principles discussed in Part I: Vision. Below is an outline of the vision.

### Game overview

Memorativa is a web application that users register to play and use as both a game and a tool. 

At its simplest, Memorativa is a manager for URLs and notes. Players add images, notes, photos, memes, videos, tweets, pins, etc. to 12 differently themed spaces where players can intuitively organize their submissions beyond simple bookmarks or folders.

Memorativa also takes the form of a game. Memorativa uses symbolically-trained AI to look for interesting relationships, patterns, and ideas in your submissions and offers suggestions for related submissions. 

As players progress, they build a meaningful curation of digital perceptions and relationships within the conceptual "memory palace" of Memorativa.

### How to Play

1. Players add **percepts** to the game. Percepts can be any content players find meaningful: URLs, tweets, videos, books, memes, images, etc. 

2. The game **prompts** the player for thoughts or more information about the percept. The system analyzes each new percept, generating metadata and finding its natural place in the themed spaces called **memory houses**.

3. Memory houses help organize percepts into an intuitive and meaningful information model, augmented by the game's AI agent.

4. As the collection of percepts grows, the game identifies potential relationships and patterns, suggesting ways to explore percepts through relationships and meaningful connections.

5. Based on analysis and game mechanics, the game provides **prompts** for players to add percepts. These are game-initiated prompts (as opposed to the player submitting un-prompted percepts) that become more interesting, personalized, and trained based on the player's information model. The player may also ask the game for prompts. Prompts have properties such as a duration, theme, and a location in the game.

6. The player responds to prompts by adding a **reply**. The reply can include a new percept or reference existing percepts.

7. The game analyzes the reply and provides the player with additional essential information and metadata. The reply helps to inform the AI about the players interests and how they like to explore ideas, which is reflected in future prompts. The player can refine the analyzed reply to better suit his intentions.

8. The reply may live in a different memory house than the location of its related prompt. Similarly, a percept may live in a different memory house than its related prompt or reply.

9. Players can generate and reply to prompts derived from existing replies, prompts, or percepts. In such cases, the new reply lives in its own memory house but stands in a **relationship** to the original reply. The relationship itself is represented as a percept in the memory houses. 

11. Replies to prompts generated from relationship percepts are considered **ideas**. 

12. Replies to prompts generated from existing ideas are **concepts**. Replies serve as nodes to generate relationships between other replies, or for further reflection to generate related replies, thereby forming a network of concepts.

13. Each percept, prompt, reply, relationship, idea, and concept is represented with a glass bead in the memory houses. Glass beads are tokens that indicate the location of the object in the houses according to the object's properties. Different grades of bead represent different kinds of objects that are related to it: percept > prompt > reply > relationships > ideas > concepts.

Percepts, prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts have locations and places in the memory houses based on their theme and related categories. 

Creating replies to prompts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "perception" beads. They denote successfully addressed prompts in the game.

Creating relationships generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "relationship" beads. They denote successfully related replies and prompts in the game.

Creating concepts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "synthesis" beads. They denote successfully synthesized concepts in the game.

The astrological lens, which begins a progressive disclosure of the various mechanics, symbols, times and durations associated with the astrological system and the use of the horoscope chart (with details and variations progressively shown to the player) is the primary symbolic lens for Memorativa.

The player may ask the AI any questions about the game, the rules, the memory houses, the perspectives, the lenses, or the glass beads. He may ask about new or existing prompts or replies, or suggestions for new prompts and replies to add to the memory houses that could follow a long-term exploration or curation strategy.

In this way, the AI prompts guide the player through advanced use of prompts, replies, and exploration of the classification system of the memory houses.

### Progressive Feature Rollout

The glass bead system implements a staged rollout approach to manage complexity and ensure stability:

```rust
pub struct FeatureRollout {
    // Feature Management
    pub active_features: HashMap<FeatureId, FeatureState>,
    pub dependencies: Vec<FeatureDependency>,
    pub rollback_config: RollbackConfig,
    
    // Testing Framework
    pub test_suites: TestSuiteConfig,
    pub validation_framework: ValidationFramework,
    pub monitoring_system: MonitoringSystem
}

pub struct TestSuiteConfig {
    // Core Tests
    pub semantic_tests: Vec<SemanticTest>,
    pub relationship_tests: Vec<RelationshipTest>,
    pub pattern_tests: Vec<PatternTest>,
    
    // Integration Tests
    pub house_integration: Vec<HouseTest>,
    pub perspective_integration: Vec<PerspectiveTest>,
    pub lens_integration: Vec<LensTest>
}

pub struct ValidationFramework {
    pub semantic_validation: SemanticValidation,
    pub relationship_validation: RelationshipValidation,
    pub pattern_validation: PatternValidation,
    pub state_validation: StateValidation
}
```

The rollout system ensures:

1. **Feature Management**
   - Controlled activation
   - Dependency tracking
   - Safe rollbacks
   - State preservation

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - Semantic verification
   - Relationship validation
   - Pattern recognition
   - State consistency

3. **Integration Validation**
   - House system integration
   - Perspective framework
   - Lens system compatibility
   - Economic model stability

This framework provides:
- Safe feature deployment
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Quality assurance
   - System stability

### Player Achievement System

The player achievement system implements a multi-layered progression model that rewards both individual development and system contributions:

```rust
pub struct PlayerAchievements {
    // Individual Progress
    pub perception_achievements: PerceptionAchievements,
    pub relationship_achievements: RelationshipAchievements,
    pub synthesis_achievements: SynthesisAchievements,
    
    // House Mastery
    pub house_achievements: HashMap<HouseId, HouseAchievements>,
    pub cross_house_achievements: CrossHouseAchievements,
    
    // Pattern Recognition
    pub pattern_discoveries: PatternDiscoveries,
    pub pattern_completions: PatternCompletions,
    
    // System Contribution
    pub quality_contributions: QualityMetrics,
    pub network_impact: NetworkImpact,
    pub community_value: CommunityValue
}

pub struct HouseAchievements {
    pub mastery_level: u8,
    pub perception_count: u32,
    pub relationship_count: u32,
    pub synthesis_count: u32,
    pub pattern_count: u32,
    pub quality_score: f64
}

pub struct PatternDiscoveries {
    pub simple_patterns: Vec<PatternRecord>,
    pub complex_patterns: Vec<PatternRecord>,
    pub novel_patterns: Vec<PatternRecord>,
    pub pattern_extensions: Vec<PatternExtension>
}
```

### Reward Distribution System

The reward system implements sophisticated distribution mechanics:

```rust
pub struct RewardSystem {
    // Base Rewards
    pub perception_rewards: PerceptionRewards,
    pub relationship_rewards: RelationshipRewards,
    pub synthesis_rewards: SynthesisRewards,
    
    // Quality Multipliers
    pub quality_multipliers: QualityMultipliers,
