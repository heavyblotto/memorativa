## Perspectives

**Perspectives** are different ways for players to explore and interact with the memory houses, providing higher-level interpretative frameworks that determine how players approach prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts. 

**Lenses** are the specific symbolic systems and tools used to implement those perspectives.

For example:

- When using the "Personal/Natal perspective", you might employ the "Astrological Lens" to interpret personal birth charts

- When using the "Mundane organization perspective", you might use the same "Astrological Lens" but focus on different aspects (like house meanings for project management)

### Perspectives integration

The primary perspectives work together with supporting dimensions to create a rich, multi-layered understanding:

- **Cross-Track Synthesis**: Players discover how different perspectives inform and enhance each other
- **Dimensional Overlay**: Supporting dimensions add depth to primary perspectives exploration
- **Pattern Recognition**: Relationships emerge between different levels of understanding
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Perspectives and dimensions shift in relevance based on context
- **Progressive Development**: Understanding deepens as players explore multiple perspectives

### Perspectives applications

Players can use perspectives to:

- Organize and categorize content
- Discover new patterns and relationships
- Deepen understanding of collected material
- Generate insights and connections
- Guide personal development
- Structure knowledge management
- Track changes and evolution
- Map conceptual territories

The AI helps players navigate these perspectives by:

- Suggesting relevant perspectives
- Highlighting connections between perspectives
- Identifying pattern relationships
- Guiding progressive exploration
- Supporting insight development
- Facilitating integration
- Maintaining overall balance
