## Lenses

The purpose of symbolic lenses is to provide players with symbols, connections, and interpretations of concepts through different core perspectives. Each lens represents a different symbolic system that can be viewed through multiple interpretative frameworks.

### Default Astrological Lens

The core symbolic system of Memorativa is based on Western astrology, providing a rich framework that can be viewed through all perspectives.

As the player progresses, the mechanics of the astrological triggers become optionally visible to the player. As the player continues to work in more conceptual and symbolic realms, more advanced mechanics are naturally available.
