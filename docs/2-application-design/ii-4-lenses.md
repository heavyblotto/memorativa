## Lenses

The purpose of symbolic lenses is to provide players with symbols, connections, and interpretations of concepts through different core perspectives. Each lens represents a different symbolic system that can be viewed through multiple interpretative frameworks.

### Default Astrological Lens

The core symbolic system of Memorativa is based on Western astrology, providing a rich framework that can be viewed through all perspectives.

As the player progresses, the mechanics of the astrological triggers become optionally visible to the player. As the player continues to work in more conceptual and symbolic realms, more advanced mechanics are naturally available.

The Lenses Reference document significantly enhances Memorativa's design by introducing a sophisticated multi-paradigm framework for symbolic pattern recognition. Here's how it integrates with and expands the core application architecture:

## Multi-Dimensional Symbolic Architecture

**Lens Integration Matrix**

| Lens System | Core Pattern Type | House Mapping | Token Impact | AI Utilization |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Chinese (I Ching) | Cyclical Temporal | Bagua Houses | Hexagram Tokens | Season-based RAG |
| Western Esoteric | Archetypal | Tarot Houses | Arcana Tokens | Symbolic Prompting |
| Kabbalistic | Energetic | Tree of Life | Sephirah Tokens | Path Analysis |
| Hermetic | Alchemical | Great Work Stages | Process Tokens | Transformation AI |
| Mathematical | Structural | Geometric Houses | Formula Tokens | Pattern Detection |
| Jungian | Psychological | Archetype Houses | Shadow Tokens | Dream Analysis |

## Key Technical Integrations

**1. Dynamic Vector Spaces**
Each lens creates its own embedding space:
```python
class LensEmbedding:
    def __init__(self, lens_type):
        self.dimensions = {
            'Chinese': 64,  # Hexagram dimensions
            'Kabbalistic': 22,  # Path dimensions
            'Mathematical': φ_dimensions  # Golden ratio-based
        }
        self.active_lens = lens_type
        
    def transform(self, percept):
        return lens_specific_embedding(percept, self.active_lens)
```

**2. Cross-Lens Pattern Recognition**
AI compares patterns across lenses:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Percept] --> B{Chinese Lens}
    A --> C[Hermetic Lens]
    A --> D[Mathematical Lens]
    B --> E[Cyclical Pattern]
    C --> F[Alchemical Stage]
    D --> G[Geometric Ratio]
    E --> H[Cross-Lens Synthesis]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

**3. Lens-Specific Merkle Trees**
Each lens maintains its own verification structure:
- Chinese: Hexagram-based Merkle forest
- Kabbalistic: Sephirah-linked Merkle paths
- Mathematical: Prime-number indexed trees

## Gameplay Enhancements

    embeddings = [lens.embed(percept) for lens in active_lenses]
    cross_attention = multi_lens_attention(embeddings)
    return aspect_pattern_detector(cross_attention)
```

**Lens-Specific Prompt Generation**

2. **Multi-Lens Aspect Patterns**
   - Hexagram (6) + Sephiroth (10) = 60-point aspect patterns
   - Hermetic Stage (4) × Chakra (7) = 28-phase cycles

3. **Cross-Paradigm Tokenization**
   - Glass Bead (Percept) + Hexagram (Change) = I Ching Token
   - Merkle Proof + Tree of Life Path = Kabbalistic NFT

## Implementation Roadmap
