## Prompts

The AI generates prompts through a sophisticated multi-layered system that integrates perspectives, lenses, and astrological mechanics. This creates a rich tapestry of interconnected prompts that guide players through their personal development and content organization journey.

**Perspective-Based Generation**:
Each prompt is generated with consideration for the four primary perspectives:

1. **Personal/Natal Perspective Prompts**:

- Focus on individual growth and development
- Examples:
  - "What's a piece of music that really moved you this week?"
  - "How has your perspective on [topic] evolved recently?"
  - "Share a moment that challenged your usual way of thinking"
- Characteristics:
  - Deeply personal and reflective
  - Tied to individual timing cycles
  - Connected to psychological patterns
  - Supporting identity development

2. **Mundane Organization Perspective Prompts**:

- Focus on practical systems and management
- Examples:
  - "Which tools or systems have you found most helpful lately?"
  - "Share a resource that helped you learn something new recently"
  - "How do you organize information about [current interest]?"
- Characteristics:
  - Project and resource oriented
  - System optimization focused
  - Documentation driven
  - Implementation focused

3. **Conceptual/Symbolic Perspective Prompts**:

- Focus on patterns and relationships
- Examples:
  - "What patterns have you noticed between different topics you're exploring?"
  - "How do these ideas connect to your broader understanding?"
  - "What metaphors help you think about [concept]?"
- Characteristics:
  - Pattern recognition oriented
  - Symbol system focused
  - Concept formation driven
  - Meaning synthesis centered

4. **Events/Temporal Perspective Prompts**:

- Focus on time-based patterns and current events
- Examples:
  - "How has recent news changed your view of [topic]?"
  - "What trends are you noticing in your field?"
  - "Which historical patterns seem relevant to current events?"
- Characteristics:
  - Time-sensitive
  - Trend-focused
  - Cycle-aware
  - Event-driven

**Lens Integration**:
As players unlock symbolic lenses, prompts become enriched with additional layers of meaning:

- **Astrological Lens** (Default):
  - Uses planetary positions and aspects for timing
  - Considers house placements for content areas
  - Tracks aspect patterns for connections
  - Monitors progressions for development
  
- **Additional Lenses** (When Unlocked):
  - Each lens adds its symbolic system to prompt generation
  - Prompts can combine multiple lens perspectives
  - Lens-specific symbolism influences prompt timing and content
  - Cross-lens patterns create rich, multi-layered prompts

**Behind the Scenes**:
The AI manages a complex system that:

1. **Perspective Integration**:

- Balances prompts across all perspectives
- Adapts to player's preferred perspectives
- Creates cross-perspective connections
- Maintains perspective development paths

2. **Lens Management**:

- Integrates available symbolic systems
- Combines lens interpretations appropriately
- Scales complexity with lens unlocks
- Maintains symbolic coherence

3. **Timing and Development**:

- Uses astrological mechanics for base timing
- Considers lens-specific timing factors
- Tracks player development cycles
- Adapts to engagement patterns

4. **Content Organization**:

- Places prompts in appropriate houses
- Creates cross-house connections
- Builds relationship networks
- Supports pattern discovery

The AI presents these complex mechanics through clear, engaging prompts that:

- Feel naturally timed and relevant
- Encourage meaningful content collection
- Support organic pattern discovery
- Build connections between memory houses
- Guide progressive exploration of ideas
- Maintain balance across perspectives
- Foster natural development of understanding
- Scale in complexity with player progress
- Adapt to unlocked lenses and capabilities

**Prompt Formats and Modalities**:
The AI generates prompts in various formats to engage different modes of thinking and response:

1. **Visual Prompts**:

- Generated symbolic imagery
- Pattern compositions
- Abstract representations
- Data visualizations
- Curated image collections
- Visual juxtapositions

Examples:

- A series of connected symbols representing emerging patterns in player's work
- Visual metaphors for current projects or interests
- Generated mandalas incorporating relevant symbols
- Data visualizations showing relationship networks

2. **Research Prompts**:

- Curated content collections
- Academic paper excerpts
- Historical parallels
- Cross-domain connections
- Emerging trends
  
Examples:

- "Recent research on [player's interest] suggests new patterns in..."
- Collection of papers showing evolution of [concept]
- Historical examples of similar patterns
- Cross-disciplinary research intersections

3. **Symbol Sets**:

- Combinations of symbolic elements
- Pattern sequences
- Symbolic correspondences
- Element relationships
Examples:
- A set of I Ching hexagrams showing transformation
- Mathematical patterns with corresponding musical notations
- Sacred geometry forms in natural sequences
- Mythological symbols in meaningful arrangements

4. **Question Prompts**:

- Open-ended exploration
- Pattern recognition
- Connection building
- Reflection catalysts

Examples:

- "Which Tarot card and I Ching hexagram best represent the transformation you're seeing in your current project?"
- "How do the sacred geometry patterns in your latest work reflect the cycle patterns you've been studying?"
- "What mythological archetype emerges when you view your recent insights through Jungian symbolism?"
- "How does the mathematical sequence in your data relate to the musical harmonies you've been exploring?"

5. **Statement Prompts**:

- Observations to consider
- Pattern suggestions
- Relationship proposals
- Synthesis offerings

Examples:

- "These three concepts in your collection share a hidden pattern..."
- "Your recent work shows parallels with this historical cycle..."
- "A new relationship emerges when viewing these ideas through..."
- "This pattern appears across multiple domains in your research..."

6. **Interactive Prompts**:

- Pattern manipulation exercises
- Symbol arrangement tasks
- Relationship mapping activities
- Concept organization challenges

Examples:

- Arrange these symbols to represent your project's evolution
- Map these concepts according to their relationships
- Transform this pattern through different symbolic lenses
- Organize these elements to reveal hidden connections

Each prompt type can be:

- Combined with others for rich, multi-modal experiences
- Enhanced through available symbolic lenses
- Adapted to player's preferred interaction styles
- Scaled in complexity as player progresses
- Customized based on current focus and interests
