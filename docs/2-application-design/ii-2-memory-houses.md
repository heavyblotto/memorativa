## Memory houses

Players use memory houses as primary navigation and as gameplay spaces in the game.

The main game view for the player is a 3 by 4 grid of the memory houses.

Each memory house also has a main house detail view.

From the main game view, the player is able to start exploring and playing the game based on certain simple visual cues and affordances.

While in the memory house detail view, the player will be able to further explore and play the game according the to themes and functions of each of the houses.

### Memory house categorization

The AI categorizes prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts according to the following properties:

- Topic (subject matter and domain)
- Media type (text, video, image, audio, etc.)
- Function or use (purpose and application)
- Relations to time and occurrence (temporal aspects)
- Personal and public (visibility level)
- Shared and private (access control)
- Directionality (inward/outward facing, consumption/creation, input/output)
- Lifecycle stage (new, active, archived, draft, complete)
- Relationship complexity (standalone, interconnected, integration depth)
- Energy/Activity level (engagement intensity, active/passive, dynamic/static)
- Access patterns (frequency, context, requirements)
