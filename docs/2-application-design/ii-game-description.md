## Game Description

This section provides a wholistic, high-level description of the application and game, what it does, how it works, and its purpose. The application is designed around concepts and principles discussed in Part I: Vision. 

### Game overview

Memorativa is a web application that users register to play and use as both a game and a tool. 

At its simplest, Memorativa is a manager for URLs and notes, and a user can derive great benefit from this feature alone. It takes the form of a game, giving the player prompts to add various kinds of categories of content at different times for different reasons.

At its most ambitious, Memorativa is a game of synthesizing ideas, concepts, and relationships.

### Game Paths

Memorativa offers two complementary paths for players:

1. **Prompt-Driven Path**: The game provides prompts that guide players to add and relate content at specific times for specific purposes.

2. **Curation Path**: Players directly add percepts to their memory houses, building their personal collection of meaningful content. The AI helps organize and discover patterns in these curated percepts.

### How to Play

#### Curation Path
1. Players add **percepts** directly to their memory houses. These can be any content they find meaningful: URLs, tweets, videos, books, memes, images, etc.

2. The system analyzes each new percept, generating metadata and finding its natural place in the memory houses based on content and timing.

3. As the collection grows, the AI identifies potential relationships and patterns, suggesting ways to transform percepts into perceptions through meaningful connections.

4. Players can explore their curated content through different perspectives and lenses, discovering new patterns and relationships.

#### Prompt-Driven Path
1. The game prompts you to add content or share thoughts. The **prompt** includes some image that represents the prompt. The player may also ask the game for prompts. Prompts have properties such as a duration, theme, and a location in the game.

2. The player responds either by adding a new **percept** or by connecting to one from their curated collection. Percepts are the raw material of the game, representing content before it has been processed or related to other elements.

3. The game analyzes the reply and provides the player with additional essential information and metadata. The reply helps to inform the AI about your interests and how you like to explore ideas, which is reflected in future prompts. The player can refine the analyzed reply to better suit his intentions.

4. The AI stores the reply along with the analysis, established relationships, and a new associated image in a **memory house**. Memory houses help organize prompts and replies into an intuitive and meaningful information model, augmented by the game's AI agent. The reply may live in a different memory house from the location of the prompt that it's related to. Replies serve as nodes to generate relationships between other replies, or for further reflection to generate related replies, thereby forming a network of concepts.

5. As more replies are added, the AI provides more prompts for the player to consider. Each prompt (and reply) has a location and home within the memory house system. Players can discover new prompts by exploring the memory houses through different **perspectives** (personal, organizational, conceptual, or temporal) and interacting with the AI. The game rewards players for successfully completed prompts and more sophisticated and elegant replies.

6. As players add more replies to the game, they may also start replying to prompts related to existing replies. In such cases, the new reply lives in its own memory house but stands in a **relationship** to the original reply. The relationship itself is represented as a reply in the memory houses. Replies that represent new relationships are considered **ideas**. Replies to existing ideas are **concepts**.

7. Intuitive tools and features are provided to the player to help organize, explore, and play with the symbols, concepts, ideas, and relationships that are discovered and cultivated within the prompt-reply system of the memory houses. As the player progresses, relationships are uncovered, connections are made, and concepts are formed within the memory house model as the AI continues to understand the player's preferences, interests, and curiosity across different perspectives, and continually surfaces related relationships, symbols, and new prompts to explore.

8. Each prompt, reply, relationship, idea, and concept is represented with a glass bead in the memory houses. Glass beads are tokens that indicate the location of the prompt in the houses according to the represented prompt's or reply's properties. Different grades of bead represent different kinds of prompts and replies that are related to it: prompt > reply > relationships > ideas > concepts.

Prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts have locations and places in the memory houses based on their theme and related categories. 

Creating replies to prompts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "perception" beads. They denote successfully addressed prompts in the game.

Creating relationships generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "relationship" beads. They denote successfully related replies and prompts in the game.

Creating concepts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "synthesis" beads. They denote successfully synthesized concepts in the game.

As play progresses, the AI will continue to guide the player with AI analysis to help the player synthesize concepts and ideas that arise from the relationships, replies and prompts. It will also ensure that the player attends to the entire ecosystem of the game.

After a certain amount of game play, **symbolic lenses** become available to the player to better understand  memory houses and their concepts and relationships. Symbolic lenses work in conjunction with **perspectives**, further refining the player's experience.

The first symbolic lens to unlock is the **astrological lens**, which begins a progressive disclosure of the various mechanics, symbols, times and durations associated with the astrological system. The use of the horoscope chart (with details and variations progressively shown to the player) is the primary symbolic chart for the symbolic lens.

The player may ask the AI any questions about the game, the rules, the memory houses, the perspectives, the lenses, or the glass beads. He may ask about new or existing prompts or replies, or suggestions for new prompts and replies to add to the memory houses that could follow a long-term exploration or curation strategy.

In this way, the AI prompts guide the player through advanced use of prompts, replies, and exploration of the classification system of the memory houses.

### Glass Bead Generation

Both paths generate glass beads:

1. **Curation Path**:
- Adding percepts generates basic glass beads
- Creating relationships between curated percepts generates perception beads
- Discovering patterns generates relationship beads

2. **Prompt-Driven Path**:
- Responding to prompts generates prompt-response beads
- Creating relationships generates relationship beads
- Synthesizing concepts generates synthesis beads

## ADD CURATION OF PERCEPTS

- players add "percepts", basic game play
- percepts = something to perceive
- perceptions = percepts that have been perceived (i.e. related to with other beads)
- "I found this cat photo", add it to my memory house
- system ingests percept, generates percept grade glass bead, locates it in the memory houses by finding an appropriate trigger
- percepts can then be used by player or AI; AI adds to RAG, can generate new analysis and prompts; player can simply curate percepts
