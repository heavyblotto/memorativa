## Game Description

This section provides a wholistic, high-level description of the application and game, what it does, how it works, and its purpose. The application is designed around concepts and principles discussed in Part I: Vision. Below is an outline of the vision.

### Game overview

Memorativa is a web application that users register to play and use as both a game and a tool. 

At its simplest, Memorativa is a manager for URLs and notes. Players add images, notes, photos, memes, videos, tweets, pins, etc. to 12 differently themed spaces where players can intuitively organize their submissions beyond simple bookmarks or folders.

Memorativa also takes the form of a game. Memorativa uses symbolically-trained AI to look for interesting relationships, patterns, and ideas in your submissions and offers suggestions for related submissions. 

As players progress, they build a meaningful curation of digital perceptions and relationships within the conceptual "memory palace" of Memorativa.

### How to Play

1. Players add **percepts** to the game. Percepts can be any content players find meaningful: URLs, tweets, videos, books, memes, images, etc. 

2. The game **prompts** the player for thoughts or more information about the percept. The system analyzes each new percept, generating metadata and finding its natural place in the themed spaces called **memory houses**.

3. Memory houses help organize percepts into an intuitive and meaningful information model, augmented by the game's AI agent.

4. As the collection of percepts grows, the game identifies potential relationships and patterns, suggesting ways to explore percepts through relationships and meaningful connections.

5. Based on analysis and game mechanics, the game provides **prompts** for players to add percepts. These are game-initiated prompts (as opposed to the player submitting un-prompted percepts) that become more interesting, personalized, and trained based on the player's information model. The player may also ask the game for prompts. Prompts have properties such as a duration, theme, and a location in the game.

6. The player responds to prompts by adding a **reply**. The reply can include a new percept or reference existing percepts.

7. The game analyzes the reply and provides the player with additional essential information and metadata. The reply helps to inform the AI about the players interests and how they like to explore ideas, which is reflected in future prompts. The player can refine the analyzed reply to better suit his intentions.

8. The reply may live in a different memory house than the location of its related prompt. Similarly, a percept may live in a different memory house than its related prompt or reply.

9. Players can generate and reply to prompts derived from existing replies, prompts, or percepts. In such cases, the new reply lives in its own memory house but stands in a **relationship** to the original reply. The relationship itself is represented as a percept in the memory houses. 

11. Replies to prompts generated from relationship percepts are considered **ideas**. 

12. Replies to prompts generated from existing ideas are **concepts**. Replies serve as nodes to generate relationships between other replies, or for further reflection to generate related replies, thereby forming a network of concepts.

13. Each percept, prompt, reply, relationship, idea, and concept is represented with a glass bead in the memory houses. Glass beads are tokens that indicate the location of the object in the houses according to the object's properties. Different grades of bead represent different kinds of objects that are related to it: percept > prompt > reply > relationships > ideas > concepts.

Percepts, prompts, replies, relationships, and concepts have locations and places in the memory houses based on their theme and related categories. 

Creating replies to prompts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "perception" beads. They denote successfully addressed prompts in the game.

Creating relationships generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "relationship" beads. They denote successfully related replies and prompts in the game.

Creating concepts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "synthesis" beads. They denote successfully synthesized concepts in the game.

The astrological lens, which begins a progressive disclosure of the various mechanics, symbols, times and durations associated with the astrological system and the use of the horoscope chart (with details and variations progressively shown to the player) is the primary symbolic lens for Memorativa.

The player may ask the AI any questions about the game, the rules, the memory houses, the perspectives, the lenses, or the glass beads. He may ask about new or existing prompts or replies, or suggestions for new prompts and replies to add to the memory houses that could follow a long-term exploration or curation strategy.

In this way, the AI prompts guide the player through advanced use of prompts, replies, and exploration of the classification system of the memory houses.

### Glass Bead Generation

Both paths generate glass beads:

1. **Curation Path**:
- Adding percepts generates basic glass beads
- Creating relationships between curated percepts generates perception beads
- Discovering patterns generates relationship beads

2. **Prompt-Driven Path**:
- Responding to prompts generates prompt-response beads
- Creating relationships generates relationship beads
- Synthesizing concepts generates synthesis beads

## ADD CURATION OF PERCEPTS

- players add "percepts", basic game play
- percepts = something to perceive
- perceptions = percepts that have been perceived (i.e. related to with other beads)
- "I found this cat photo", add it to my memory house
- system ingests percept, generates percept grade glass bead, locates it in the memory houses by finding an appropriate trigger
- percepts can then be used by player or AI; AI adds to RAG, can generate new analysis and prompts; player can simply curate percepts
