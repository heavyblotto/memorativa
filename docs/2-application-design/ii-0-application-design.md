## Application description

Memorativa is a web-based application that combines elements of a knowledge management system, social bookmarking, and a symbolic pattern recognition game. At its core, it provides users (called players) with a structured environment organized into twelve "memory houses" - distinct spaces that correspond to different domains of knowledge and experience, modeled after the astrological house system.

Players interact with the system by adding various types of content - URLs, notes, images, videos, and other media - which become "percepts" within the memory houses. These percepts are represented as glass beads, visual tokens that serve as the fundamental units of interaction within the system. The placement and relationships between these beads are governed by an astrological framework that provides natural semantic boundaries and temporal context.

The application employs an AI system that generates prompts through an astrologically-authorized mechanism, encouraging players to reflect on and connect their collected content in meaningful ways. When players respond to these prompts, new glass beads of varying grades are created, representing different levels of cognitive engagement: from simple perception to complex concept formation. The system tracks and validates these interactions through a sophisticated token architecture that ensures semantic integrity and maintains verifiable relationship lineages.

Memorativa incorporates multiple perspectives through which content can be viewed and organized: Personal/Natal, Mundane Organization, Conceptual/Symbolic, and Events/Temporal. These perspectives are implemented through various "lenses," with the astrological system serving as the primary symbolic framework. This multi-dimensional approach allows for rich pattern recognition and meaning-making across different domains of knowledge and experience.

The application features a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated with the astrological framework, enabling sophisticated content analysis and relationship mapping. This integration supports both individual knowledge development and collective meaning-making while maintaining privacy and security through careful access control and data protection measures.

What distinguishes Memorativa from traditional social media or note-taking applications is its focus on reflection and pattern recognition rather than reactive engagement. The system is designed to encourage deeper understanding and connection-making through its game mechanics, while providing a structured environment for personal knowledge development and creative synthesis. The application serves both as a practical tool for organizing digital content and as a platform for exploring and developing more complex conceptual relationships through play.

Through this unique combination of knowledge management, symbolic interpretation, and gamification, Memorativa aims to create an environment where players can develop richer understanding of their collected content while engaging in meaningful pattern recognition and concept formation activities. The system's architecture supports both individual exploration and potential collective knowledge development, all while maintaining the integrity of personal meaning-making processes.
