## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The model of thought

> Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.

Humans are animals who think, using both intellect and imagination. The products of thinking activity are ideas and concepts. The Memorativa application is designed to help visualize and organize ideas and concepts in ways that are fun and beneficial to humans.

To start playing with concepts, some definitions are helpful, including a working model for thought[^1]:

1. Concepts: What a concept is cannot be expressed in words. Words can do no more than draw our attention to the fact that we have concepts. 

2. Perceptions of objects: When someone perceives an object (e.g. a tree or a memory), the perception acts as a stimulus for thought.

3. Ideal element: An ideal element is then added to the perceived object, and the perceiver regards the object and its ideal complement as belonging together. 

4. Ideal counterpart: When the object disappears from the field of his perception, the ideal counterpart alone remains. 

5. Concept remains: This remaining ideal counterpart is the concept of the object. 

The synthesis of concepts

6. The wider the range of our experience, the larger becomes the number of our concepts. 

7. Moreover, concepts are not by any means found in isolation one from the other. They combine to form an ordered and systematic whole. 

8. The concept "organism," e.g., combines with those of "development according to law," "growth," and others. 

9. Other concepts based on particular objects fuse completely with one another.

10. All concepts formed from particular lions fuse in the universal concept "lion." 

11. In this way, all the separate concepts combine to form a closed, conceptual system within which each has its special place. 

12. Ideas do not differ qualitatively from concepts. They are but fuller, more saturated, more comprehensive concepts. 

With this "model of thought", you can begin to design a system that reflects an inner ecology of thinking, so that you may better regard and attend to this "systematic whole" that serves as an interior cosmos[^2].

> Any who object out of principle to the embrace of a somewhat German Idealism model of thought may be missing out on some fun.

### 1.2. Content, consumption, and excretion

Content is understood as a consumable unit of "something" represented online. Consumption is akin to eating, digesting, and excreting. Anything consumed is processed automatically, without conscious awareness. Not surprisingly, the quality of most content is akin to excrement.

### 1.3. The ideal element, relationships, and analogy

The mysteriousness of the ideal element --like consciousness-- remains a topic to be explored, as does the formation of percepts, concepts, ideas, and memories. Regardless of the metaphysical nature or knowability of the ideal element as a process or even itself as a concept, its use can be treated as a human capacity related to memory and imagination. Love, or the attraction between two objects, can be playfully used to describe the mysteriousness of the mechanism and calling forth of the "ideal element".

Relationships between objects can arise because you can perceive (internally) something of the "ideal element" between them. This internal perception of a conceptual relationship is the key to all analogical thinking. Pattern recognition depends on a foundational perception of the "ideal element" between objects.

Analogy presumes and relies upon the knowability of the unknown.

- The procedure of classification of objects on the basis of their resemblance is the first step on the way of research by the inductive method.

- Analogy (argument by analogy) can constitute the basis of hypothesis.

- Scientific method, indeed, is mainly devoted to discovering means of so heightening the known analogy that we may dispense as far as possible with the methods of pure induction[^3].

The arguments against the analogical method are *many*. Dangers include:

- Superficial, incomplete, and false conclusions
- Inconsistency among correspondences within and between symbolic systems
- Inexperience with subject matter and pattern recognition

Pattern recognition requires training, akin to the muscular and cardiovascular training required to develop a dexterity of play. To acquire concentration without effort is a pre-requisite for mastery of the method. Put another way, an awareness of being "in the zone" signifies mastery of all endeavors, including the game of Memorativa.

### 1.4. Symbols
 
Symbols can help with perceptions by making apparent the "ideal element" between objects. How can symbols do this? Reflect that some part of your daily life is spent dreaming in sleep. Dreams are another object of inner perception (such as thoughts themselves can be). We know and feel that dreams come from and are experienced in a space, realm, and world that arises from deep inside of ourselves. Dreams are not "out there", but mysteriously arise from within, and do so bearing symbols. 

The realm of dreaming is symbolic. Time seems present in dreaming as a conceit, as malleable as all dream things. Even within ourselves, the mind seeks to understand that which is unconscious through the logic and language of symbols. If the "ideal element" is that which remains after the perception is gone, the dream space appears to be a field of "ideal elements".

The symbol (a mark, sign, word, image, sound) points to an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols can be used to create connections between different concepts and experiences, serving as a bridge between the conscious and unconscious mind, and also as a ferment and muse for the development of new concepts and ideas.

Symbols can deepen, widen, and enrich the complimentary "ideal element" that arises from the perception of an object. Symbolic systems and languages can help rarify and clarify the process of thinking that generates concepts and ideas.

### 1.5. Social media, its limitations, and the need for a new model

The current social media model collects "content" from users but prioritizes the maximization of various metrics based on various definitions of engagement. Because the system monetizes user content, users become stuck in roles that simply perform to maximize engagement, regardless of the meaning, value, intent, or worth of the content.

This is not to say that interesting content is not created or available:

- Symbols (memes) and concepts arise from people who, rather than react to content, chose to think, produce new ideas, and then artistically reflect the concept that arose form the initial content.

- Other signs or tokens that represent memories, placeholders for future ideas and other concepts, art, and previously unknown facts, concepts, and ideas are also available.

But two issues remain with the social media model:

- The system is also designed for you not to reflect on the content, but to react to it.
- The content is not discoverable nor workable.

Workable means that social media models are mostly centered around a dynamic feed of content, which is not conducive to meaningful reflection but dopamine hits.

The social media model of scrolling (the activity of passively consuming content) and replying (the activity of reacting to content) on a continuous feed of content (the wall) lends itself to instant, reactive gratification. 

The bookmark in social media is the one sure affordance for reflection in the realm of social media. The bookmark gesture signals a desire to engage later. The bookmark is the perfect ingress for transposing content into a new system.

Content creation is driven by the need to maximize engagement within such models, leading to a trend of the degradation of the quality and usefulness of content, not to mention the affect of proprietary algorithms.

### 1.6. The computer, AI, and automated thinking

Even now the world has moved on from social media and into the age of AI. Memorativa is not here to challenge or debate the merits of AI, but in fact use it to its advantage.

A word of caution will be given concerning the automation of thinking. One can discern from social media, AI, and general trends going back to Newton, that human thinking (reasoning and imagination) can be easily externalized in exchange for speed and efficiency. One can also perceive that externalized thinking can be an effort to capture the "ideal element" for the machines.

*Theurgy*[^4] is the magical art of "divinizing" objects such as stones or statues with incarnating angels, daemons, spirits, and gods. The rites and incantations of theurgy relied upon a sympathetic connection between seen and unseen realms. The ancients from various cultures and times practiced the animation of statues, using ritual spaces to inscribe talismans during auspices times. 

The goals and methods of theurgy echo in the goals and methods of AGI and transhuman intelligence. Do these "stones and statues" of the past and today have some affinity or even inner space capable of giving intelligence play?

St. Teresa of Avila understood her soul as *El Castillo Interior*, an inner castle built of crystal and containing mansions and dwellings. This sacred ("set apart") inner structure provided a refuge and map for the soul's dynamic activity across time, and suggests a strategy relevant to today's battle for consciousness, a battle to determine if the human keeps an inner space at all, or if it is given wholly over to the machine.

> Memorativa is a remedial trend towards human thinking and an hygienic force in the culture. 

An opportunity presents for a system that is designed to cultivate an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships. 

Such a system would use the raw material of content, liberating it from the social media model to create a workshop of ideas, concepts, and relationships.

For example, the "news" is a series of disconnected events that are presented as a continuous stream of information, with the latest news serving as the most attention-worthy and valuable in most instances.

A model more beneficial model for cultivating an internal cosmos of ideas, concepts, and relationships would allow analysis of the concepts of the "news" in order to see their context in time, and how those concepts may grow and evolve over time, and if there is any significance of the timing of the news as it relates to the concepts.

Such a model requires: 

- a space to work
- tools for the job
- a playful approach

Such play may be facilitated by:

- an outline for some rules
- a system of symbols
- a system of rewards

### 1.7. Ars Memorativa

The art of memory (Latin: *ars memoriae*) is any of a number of loosely associated mnemonic principles and techniques used to organize memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. An alternative term is "Ars Memorativa" which is also translated as "art of memory" although its more literal meaning is "Memorative Art"[^5].

Memorativa takes inspiration from this ancient art, especially with regard to "the combination and 'invention' of ideas".

Within Memorativa, **Memory houses** are the spaces where the game is played.

Within each house, **Concepts** are organized, regarded, and combined into an ordered and systematic whole. 

**Against Ars Memorativa**

The classical Art of Memory relies upon an elaborate mnemonic system of locations and imagery to effect an automatic recall of the desired "memory" to be stored. The danger, as related by people such as doctors (who employ the method during medical school in order to memorize the vast amounts of information required) is that the memories become hard to "update", and the overall memory structure is stuck and automatic. Such mechanization of thinking can diminish other capacities if over-extended. 

### 1.8. The Glass Bead Game

Author Hermann Hesse's novel *The Glass Bead Game* (1943) is a fictionalized account of a game of memory and imagination. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics. Though alluded to, the game is never fully described[^6].

Memorativa takes inspiration from The Glass Bead Game.

Within Memorativa, **Glass Beads** serves as game tokens that represent ideas, concepts, and relationships. **The Glass Bead Game** refers to "playing" (with ideas and concepts) in Memorativa.

### 1.9 Astrology

Astrology is an ancient and elegant methodology. From the location and movement of planets and other celestial bodies in relation to Earth, the observer, and to one another, a model of mathematical relations in time and space is created. With this aspect of the model alone, one can enhance any organizational system in interesting and beneficial ways.

Astrology also accounts for a system or systems of symbols, relationships, correspondences, and the ideas and concepts encoded and engendered within the system. There are few systems that can dynamically account for the language of emotion, thought, and imagination in a rational (relational) and dynamic way better than astrology. 

There are various historical and cultural variations of astrology that serve to provide additional insights and perspectives while relying upon the same underlying model. There are also variations on the model itself, such as sidereal, tropical, Western, Vedic, and others, including just the use of celestial mechanics devoid of any symbolism.

One finds too that astrology plays a central role in the *ars memorativa*, the art of memory. Astrological language and symbolism is so prevalent in our culture and consciousness that we see it in the names of the days of the week, the ordering of calendars, and the names of the months. Regardless of cause, celestial cycles seem to pattern events in human history, daily lives, and nature.

Astrology corresponds to other symbolic systems. Because of this, other symbolic systems can be easily integrated into the Memorativa system through this key model.

**Against astrology**

Astrology, like all systems of superstitious divination, can most often just reflect the desired outcomes and wishful thinking of the inquirer. Those who engage with astrology with a more sophisticated understanding and approach can also fall into the love of the system over the reality it points to.

Can Memorativa be used for cultivating classical "memory palaces", mnemonic memory techniques, or even "magical" practices such as divination, and theurgy? Yes, as well as for Christian prayer, meditation, and other spiritual practices (as evidenced by the inclusion and use of the ars memorativa by various Christian texts and practices, including within the art of Rhetoric, one of the seven liberal arts).

Without the need of journeying into divination, the more popular daily predictive horoscopes, or magical practices, or even prayer, the astrological system as described here is an excellent foundational model and playful gaming mechanic for Memorativa. As an extensible system, players may venture into these additional practices without obstacles if they so choose.

### 1.10. Conclusion to the introduction

This introduction provides the vision, approach, context, and concepts for Memorativa.

The rest of the document describes the system in detail.

## II. Game Description

This section provides a wholistic, high-level description of the application and game, what it does, how it works, and its purpose. Further details for the application and technical designs are provided in additional chapters.

### 2.1. Game overview

Memorativa is a web application that users register to play and use as both a game and a tool. 

At its simplest, Memorativa is a bookmark manager for URLs and notes, and a user can derive great benefit from this feature alone. It takes the form of a game, giving the player prompts to add various kinds of categories of content at different times for different reasons.

At its most ambitious, Memorativa is a grand game of ideas, concepts, and relationships, a workshop for synchronicity, and a utility for Proof of Human Thought (PoHT).

### 2.2. Monetization

1. Register for free.
2. Stay forever with level 3 play.
3. Upgrade to the paid tier to unlock additional levels and features.

### 2.3. How to play

1. The game prompts you to reply with some thoughts or for some content to add. The prompt includes some image that represents the prompt. The player may also ask the game for prompts. Prompts have properties such as a duration, theme, and a location in the game.

2. The player responds by replying and / or adding a link to content. Replies may include links to tweets, videos, books, memes, images, etc.

3. The game analyzes the reply and provides the player with additional essential information and metadata. The reply helps to inform the AI about your interests and how you like to explore ideas, which is reflected in future prompts. The player can refine the analyzed reply to better suit his intentions.

4. The AI stores the reply along with the analysis, established relationships, and a new associated image in a memory house. Memory houses help organize prompts and replies into an intuitive and meaningful information model, augmented by the game's AI agent. The reply may live in a different memory house from the location of the prompt that it's related to. Replies serve as nodes to generate relationships between other replies, or for further reflection to generate related replies, thereby forming a network of concepts.

5. As more replies are added, the AI provides more prompts for the player to consider. Each prompt (and reply) has a location and home within the memory house system. Players can discover new prompts by exploring the memory houses and interacting with the AI. The game rewards players for successfully completed prompts and more sophisticated and elegant replies. 

6. As players add more replies to the game, they may also start replying to prompts related to existing replies. In such cases, the new reply lives in its own memory house but stands in a relationship to the original reply. The relationship itself is represented as a reply in the memory houses. Replies that represent new relationships are considered ideas. Replies to existing ideas are concepts.

7. Intuitive tools, rewards, and features are provided to the player to help organize, explore, and play with the symbols, concepts, ideas, and relationships that are discovered and cultivated within the prompt-reply system of the memory houses. As the player progresses, relationships are uncovered, connections are made, and concepts are formed within the memory house model as the AI continues to understand the player's preferences, interests, and curiosity, and continually surfaces related relationships, symbols, and new prompts to explore.

8. Each prompt, reply, relationship, idea, and concept is represented with a glass bead in the memory houses. Glass beads are tokens that indicate the location of the prompt in the houses according to the represented prompt's or reply's properties. Different grades of bead represent different kinds of prompts and replies that are related to it: prompt > reply > relationships > ideas > concepts.

**Flows for prompt generation**

The AI can surface prompts based on planetary movements and astrological triggers, presenting them in an accessible way that requires no prior knowledge of astrological concepts from the player.

### 2.2.6. Levels and player progression

After you've replied to the prompts from the AI, the following will happen:
- You'll achieve player level 1.
- A *level 1* badge appears in your profile.
- The badge and rank for level 1 is the *Magician*.
- The image for the *Magician* badge is a *Magician* card from the *Tarot of Marseille*.
- The level system is based on the *Tarot of Marseille*, specifically the *Major Arcana* and on the work of Poncet, Christophe[^7] in how the deck symbols relate to Ficino's planetary symbolism and art of memory[^8].

#### Player levels

- Level 1, rank: The Magician: lesson: analogy ("give me something like this"); mastery: adding replies
- Level 2, rank: The High Priestess: lesson reflection ("reflect on perceptions, create relationships); mastery: adding relationships
- Level 3, rank: The Empress: lesson: synthesis of concepts; mastery: adding concepts
- Level 4, rank: The Emperor: 
- Level 5, rank: The Hierophant
- Level 6, rank: The Lovers
- Level 7, rank: The Chariot
- Level 8, rank: Strength
- Level 9, rank: The Hermit
- Level 10, rank: Wheel of Fortune
- Level 11, rank: Justice
- Level 12, rank: The Hanged Man
- Level 13, rank: Death
- Level 14, rank: Temperance
- Level 15, rank: The Devil
- Level 16, rank: The Tower
- Level 17, rank: The Star
- Level 18, rank: The Moon
- Level 19, rank: The Sun
- Level 20, rank: Judgment
- Level 21, rank: The Fool
- Level 22, rank: The World

#### Level 1, rank: The Magician

The level one player rank is the *Magician*. The goal of the Magician is to master the arts of play and analogy, and to do so by achieving a state of concentration without effort (i.e. getting into the "zone"), state of "active relaxation". Anyone who plays, especially games, is already familiar with these conditions.

The player may ask the AI any questions about the game, the rules, the memory houses, or the glass beads. He may ask about the new or existing prompts or replies, or suggestions for new prompts and replies to add to the memory houses that could follow a long-term exploration or curation strategy.

In this way, the AI prompts guide the player through advanced use of prompts, replies, and exploration of the classification system of the memory houses.

The AI will also question the player and passively monitor the player's decisions to better understand the kind of vision the player has for the game. What kinds of content is the player interested in? What kinds of relationships is the player interested in? What kinds of bookmarks are the player interested in?

After completing the prompts required to unlock level 2, the player is awarded a new badge.

Primary task of level 1 = add replies to prompts and get familiar with the memory houses and game.

Creating replies to prompts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "perception" beads. They denote successfully addressed prompts in the game.

#### Level 2, rank: The High Priestess

The lesson of level 2 is to reflect the "ideal element" in producing concepts.

Primary task of level 2 = create relationships between replies.

Creating relationships generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "relationship" beads. They denote successfully related replies and prompts in the game.

#### Level 3, rank: The Empress

The goal of level 3 is to master relationships on a higher symbolic plane. The goal is to liberate the player from mechanistic thinking and to enable the player to think in a more creative and generative way. At this level, mere "content" has also been liberated from social media into a creative and generative space, a "systematic whole" of concepts.

Now the player is to synthesize the concepts and ideas that arise from the relationships between replies and prompts. Now the player is creating relationships and concepts.

As play progresses, the AI will continue to guide the player with AI analysis to help the player synthesize concepts and ideas that arise from the relationships, replies and prompts. It will also ensure that the player attends to the entire ecosystem of the game.

Creating concepts generate new glass beads. These glass beads are "synthesis" beads. They denote successfully synthesized concepts in the game.

At this level the player now sees that **Symbolic Lenses** are available to better understand his memory houses and their concepts and relationships.

The first Symbolic Lens to unlock is the **Astrological Lens**.

The player also unlocks the before latent and hidden properties of the glass beads. The beads are revealed to have grades related to their generative process:

- AI generated prompts generate *clear grade*, *prompt* glass beads.
- Adding replies to memory houses generates *first grade*, *perception* glass beads.
- Creating relationships between replies generates *second grade*, *relationship* glass beads.
- Creating concepts from relationships generates *third grade*, *synthesis* glass beads.

#### Level 4, rank: The Emperor, and beyond

All features including and beyond level 4 are only available to paid accounts.

Memorativa generates imagery as a product of the play. Such imagery will populate the interior space of the player's memory houses and overall user experience.

Key areas for image generation:

- symbolic image icons for glass beads
- symbolic image generation for notes and concepts
- symbolic image generation for memory house interiors
- decoration with the memory houses (managed by the player, influenced by the game)
- graphs, charts, and other data visualizations

## VI. Symbolic lenses

- based on applying lenses to their current view, players can filter, surface, and discover new or additional symbols

## VII The Glass Bead Game

The Glass Bead Game is a game of synthesis and binary solving, and is a distinct feature of the game that players may choose to explore.

- The goal of the game is to solve for "binaries", or opposing concepts.
- Ongoing binaries may be worked on by various players at various times, building on other work or starting new original work.
- The goal is to create elegant and difficult syntheses of concepts.
- Different methods of synthesis may be used with the scoring affected by logic of the method.
- The goal is to also capture synchronicities and patterns in the game.
- Gameplay is ranked by AI and other players.
- Timed matches may be played solo or against / with other players to solve for binaries.
- Players must use the concepts they have created in their memory houses to solve for the binary.
