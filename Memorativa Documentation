### Section Ordering Rules

The following rules govern the structure and ordering of document sections:

1. **Mandatory Sections**: Title, Introduction, Section Headings, Key Comparisons, Key Innovations, Key Points are mandatory for all documents.

2. **Optional Sections**: Key Math, Code Examples, Diagrams and Visualizations, See Also, and Citations are optional and should only be included when relevant to the document's content.

3. **Fixed Order**: When included, sections must appear in the following order:
   - Title (always first)
   - Introduction (always second)
   - Section Headings (always third)
   - Key Math (if applicable, always after last Section Heading)
   - Code Examples (if applicable, always after Key Math if present, otherwise last Section Heading)
   - Key Comparisons (always after Code Examples if present, otherwise after Key Math if present, otherwise after the last Section Heading)
   - Key Innovations (always after Key Comparisons)
   - Key Points (always after Key Innovations)
   - Citations (if applicable, always after Key Points)
   - See Also (always last)
   - Diagrams and Visualizations (if applicable, inline with Section Heading content)

This structure ensures that all documents maintain a consistent format while allowing flexibility for document-specific needs.

### Key Comparisons Section

Each document must include a "Key Comparisons" section that contextualizes Memorativa within the broader landscape of related systems, models, or theories. This section should:

1. Compare and contrast Memorativa's approach with established systems in relevant domains (AI, cognitive science, philosophy, mathematics, etc.)
2. Use a tabular format to highlight differences and similarities across multiple dimensions
3. Provide balanced analysis that acknowledges both advantages and limitations of the Memorativa approach
4. Include appropriate citations to the systems being compared
5. Focus on substantive comparisons rather than superficial differences

Example format:

```markdown
## Key Comparisons

| Aspect | Traditional AI | Memorativa |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Knowledge Representation | High-dimension embeddings | Structured triplets |
| Training Data | Static corpus | Continuous human-machine synthesis |
| Interpretability | Post-hoc explanations | Built-in semantic structure |
| Economic Model | Centralized platforms | Tokenized perceptual labor |
| Cognitive Model | Statistical prediction | Analogical prototyping |
```

The Key Comparisons section should identify 3-7 critical dimensions of comparison that highlight Memorativa's distinctive features while accurately representing alternative approaches. Each comparison should be substantiated by references to established work in the field.

### Key Innovations Section

Each document must include a "Key Innovations" section that explicitly identifies the novel contributions made by the Memorativa system. This section should:

1. Highlight genuinely new approaches, mechanisms, or frameworks introduced by Memorativa
2. Distinguish between incremental improvements and fundamental innovations
3. Provide precise descriptions of each innovation with appropriate citations to prior art
4. Explain the significance and potential impact of each innovation
5. Connect innovations to specific challenges or limitations in existing systems

Example format:

```markdown
## Key Innovations

- **Percept-Triplet Structure**: A novel three-vector encoding system (Archetypal/Expression/Mundane) that provides fixed semantic dimensions for computational concept representation while maintaining human interpretability [citation1, citation2].

- **Dimensional Compression Through Symbolic Anchoring**: Repurposing culturally persistent archetypal structures as mathematical anchors in AI vector space, reducing thousands of dimensions to just 34 (10+12+12) while preserving semantic relationships [citation3, citation4].

- **Glass Bead Token Economy**: A first-of-its-kind economic system that creates value from perceptual labor and concept formation rather than content creation, addressing both AI model collapse and post-automation economic challenges simultaneously [citation5, citation6].
```

An innovation should only be included if it represents a significant departure from existing approaches and offers a new solution to a recognized problem. Each innovation should be supported by references to the most closely related prior work to clearly establish its novelty.
